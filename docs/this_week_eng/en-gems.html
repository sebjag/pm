But the final one which utterly ‘broke’ up Israel so as to be ‘not a people,’ accompanied by a colonization of Samaria with foreigners, was under Esar-haddon, who carried away Manasseh, king of Judah, also, in the twenty-second year of his reign, sixty-five years from the utterance of this prophecy (cf. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000144/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezra 4.2, 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000144/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 10</a>, with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000144/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Kings 17.24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000144/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 33.11</a>).”</p>

<strong>Esar-haddon</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>The “Sixty-Five Years.”</strong> At the time of the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem some of the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land referred to their having been brought to Samaria by “Esar-haddon the king of Assyria.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001416/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezr 4:2</a>) That the Assyrian transplantation of people to and from Samaria continued until his reign is viewed by some as a clue to the understanding of the period of “sixty-five years” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001416/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:8</a> with regard to the desolation of Ephraim (with its capital at Samaria). The interval extending from the reign of Tiglath-pileser III (who initiated the deportation of people from the northern kingdom of Israel shortly after Isaiah’s prophecy) to that of Esar-haddon would allow for such a 65-year period until the complete ‘shattering to pieces’ of Ephraim “so as not to be a people.”</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">This prophecy was given after Pekah the king of Israel invaded Judah during the reign of King Ahaz. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971807/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 7:1</a>) According to the Bible, Pekah reigned for a period of about twenty years, and in the seventeenth year of his reign, or in 762 B.C.E., Ahaz became king. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971807/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Ki. 15:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971807/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 16:1</a>) So it must have been not long after 762 B.C.E. that the sixty-five years of Isaiah’s prophecy began to count. In 740 B.C.E. the Assyrians overthrew the Northern Kingdom of Israel. So, that kingdom, with Ephraim as its dominant tribe, came to its end approximately twenty years after Isaiah foretold that Ephraim would be “shattered to pieces.” However, it was not until the reign of Esar-haddon the king of Assyria that a final transplantation of foreign peoples into Israelite territory occurred. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971807/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 4:2</a>) Apparently with the deportation of Israelites and this final transplantation of foreigners, Ephraim was “shattered to pieces so as not to be a people.” Between the fall of the Northern Kingdom and Esar-haddon’s rule, the reigns of Assyrian kings Sargon and Sennacherib had intervened. Inscriptions show Esar-haddon to be a contemporary of Judean King Manasseh (whose rule ran from 716 B.C.E. to 661 B.C.E.). So, the interval extending from the time that the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971807/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:8</a> were uttered until Esar-haddon’s transplantation effort would certainly allow for the sixty-five-year period of Isaiah’s prophecy.</p>

<strong>A Pivotal Date in History</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 3:6</a> it is stated: “From the first day of the seventh month on they started to offer up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah, when the foundation of Jehovah’s temple itself had not yet been laid.” This would be, according to the Gregorian Calendar, <span id="page570" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="570" data-before-text="570"></span>on September 28/29, of 537 B.C.E.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965684/3">d</a> So on the first day of the month they celebrated the new moon of the seventh month of that year. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Num. 10:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 28:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 1 Sam. 20:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/4" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> 24</a>) On the fifteenth day of that month they kept God’s law by beginning the seven-day festival of the booths, the festival of the ingathering.

When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests in official clothing, with the trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, stood up to praise Jehovah according to the direction of David the king of Israel. . . . And many of the priests and the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses, the old men that had seen the former house [built by Solomon], were weeping with a loud voice at the laying of the foundation of this house before their eyes, while many others were raising the voice in shouting for joy.” This confusion of sounds was heard far away.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezra 3:8-13</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">But this work was not done without difficulty. Only clean, dedicated hands could have a share in rebuilding Jehovah’s house, so the people of the lands round about were denied a share in the work. They began to interfere with the building. They used every possible means to “frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia down till the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezra 4:1-5</a>) Finally they procured an edict from the king of Persia ordering the Jews to stop building. “It was then that the work on the house of God, which was in Jerusalem, stopped; and it continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezra 4:6-24</a>) This is, of course, not Darius the Mede, but King Darius I the Persian, who began ruling the empire in 522 B.C.E.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">In our next two issues we shall see that the enemies of God could not really thwart the rebuilding of the temple and of Jerusalem itself, also accurately timed by Jehovah. But the foregoing is sufficient to prove that the date 537 B.C.E. is a very important one. To Jehovah’s mind and likewise to the faithful remnant of Jews who returned from Babylon, it was important at that time. It is important to Bible students, for by means of it they can determine the length of time that man has been on the earth, the time of the flood of Noah’s day, of the making of the Abrahamic covenant, of the Exodus from Egypt, of the forty years’ wandering of Israel in the wilderness and of numerous other vitally important Bible events. It is important <em>to every one of us,</em> for by it we can corroborate the evidence of the physical facts taking place showing the end of the “seven times,” “the appointed times of the nations” and the establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ, in the heavens, in 1914 C.E.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204404/125/0">7/15/1960, pp. 424-426</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>The Samaritans—a Fading People</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the lapse of time, between the exiling of the Israelites and the bringing of these foreigners into the emptied Samaritan cities, the land became infested with wild beasts. The inspired account says: “It came about at the start of their dwelling <span id="page425" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="425" data-before-text="425"></span>there that they did not fear Jehovah. Therefore Jehovah sent lions among them and they came to be killers among them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:25</a>) These pagans believed that each district and country had its own god and that to prosper they must learn how to appease the God of this land. So they sent word to their king requesting that someone be sent to teach them the ways of Jehovah, that they might know how to worship the God of Israel. The king sent back a Samaritan priest, who took up residence at Bethel. He began to teach these foreigners the ways of Jehovah. The pagan settlers incorporated this worship of the God of Israel with their demon worship. A mixed religion resulted—the Samaritan religion. The few remaining Israelites became miserably corrupted both in their behavior and in their religion. They married foreigners and brought forth a mixed race, composed partly of Israelites and partly of settlers. This mixture of humanity became known as Samaritans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 4:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This idolatrous religious concoction continued for about three hundred years, down till the building of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim by the governor of Samaria, Sanballat the Horonite, said to be with the sanction of Alexander the Great. Earlier, during the reigns of Hezekiah and Josiah, some few returned to true worship. The high places of demon worship of Samaria were destroyed. Their altars were desecrated, their priests slain and all the remnant of Israel acknowledged the temple on Mount Zion or, more specifically, on adjacent Mount Moriah. Any restoration of true worship, however, was short-lived. With the death of Josiah the land of Samaria fell back into idolatrous worship.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>THE SAMARITAN SCHISM</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Nothing is known of the Samaritans from Josiah’s time down till the arrival of Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest in Palestine in 537 B.C. These men were authorized by King Cyrus to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. The Samaritans approached them with an offer to assist them in their building program, but Zerubbabel rejected their offer. This treatment roused the wrath of the Samaritans. By the time Ezra arrived on the scene in Jerusalem nearly seventy years later, the ill feeling had faded and the Jews and the Samaritans were on the friendliest of terms. In fact, too friendly for Ezra’s liking, for the Jews had intermarried with the Samaritans. Ezra, the priest, declared these intermarriages illegal, contrary to God’s instruction given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 34:16</a>. He called for the Jews to separate themselves from their foreign wives. This caused much resentment among both the Jews and the Samaritans. Many influential Jews refused to listen to Ezra’s appeal and fled to Samaria. The Samaritans became embittered with the way their womenfolk and children were being treated. This led to a sharp division between the Jews and the Samaritans.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">During Nehemiah’s absence from Jerusalem, about 443 B.C., the Jews again married Samaritan women. When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem, he insisted that they separate from their foreign wives. Nehemiah says: “One of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. So I chased him away from me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 13:28</a>) It was Nehemiah and not popular Jewish sentiment that expelled the unworthy priestling. This led to more resentment.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Bible says nothing more about this and in no way connects it with the Samaritan schism. The Jewish historian Josephus, however, informs us that a nephew of this man whom Nehemiah chased away from him married a daughter of Sanballat, the governor of Samaria. The nephew’s name was Manasseh. The elders of Jerusalem <span id="page426" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="426" data-before-text="426"></span>were quite indignant that a relative of the high priest should marry a foreigner. They demanded that Manasseh either divorce his wife or not serve in the priesthood. All Jerusalem was in an uproar over this, because many priests and Levites were entangled in these marriages. When Manasseh refused to give up his Samaritan wife, he was thrown out of the country. A number of priests, who also refused to separate from their wives, joined him.</p>

<strong>Assyria</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">It was during the reign of Menahem of Israel (791-780 B.C.E.) that Tiglath-pileser III entered the domain of that northern kingdom. Menahem made a payment to him of one thousand silver talents (about $1,423,590) and thus obtained the withdrawal of the Assyrian.

He put down an uprising in Egypt and sacked the city of Thebes (No-amon; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Nahum 3:7, 8</a>). The boundaries of the Assyrian Empire now embraced the regions of Elam, part of Media up into Ararat, as far W as Cilicia in Asia Minor, through Syria and Palestine, down into Egypt, Arabia, and Babylonia. He appears to be the “great and honorable Asenappar” referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ezra 4:10</a>.—See ASENAPPAR.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Prior to Esar-haddon’s death he had appointed his son Ashurbanipal as ‘king of the realm’ and another son, Shamashshumukin, as king of Babylon. Shamashshumukin later rebelled against his brother, and Ashurbanipal overcame the rebellion and sacked the city of Babylon. The remainder of Ashurbanipal’s reign, and, in fact, that of the Assyrian Empire, is obscure. Commenting on this <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible</em> (Vol. 1, p. 274) says: “Whether this fight taxed the strength of Assyria too much or whether it was for other, unknown reasons, a strange period of silence blacks out the last twenty years of the reign of Ashurbanipal. . . . the country seems to have fallen with appalling suddenness into obscurity.”</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">As will be noted in our article on NINEVEH, we have accepted the year 632 B.C.E. as the probable date for the fall of Nineveh, whereas most reference <span id="page155" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="155" data-before-text="155"></span>works place it at the year 612 B.C.E., or some twenty years thereafter. The uncertainty of the history of that period as found in secular records is acknowledged, and, as is demonstrated in our article on CHRONOLOGY, we have relied on the chronological framework indicated in the Bible record and have accommodated secular history to it, rather than give precedence to what may be presently accepted and popular in the way of chronology but which is often conjectural or based on evidence that is undeniably weak.</p>

<strong>Esar-haddon</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>Esar-haddon states that, prior to his father’s death, he had already been selected as heir apparent (after due consultation of the gods and liver-divination), and he seems to have served as viceroy at Babylon before becoming king of Assyria. Following his father’s assassination, Esar-haddon tells of pursuing the murderers to Armenia (the “land of Ararat,” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:37</a>), where he defeated them. His official reign is considered to have lasted twelve years.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Early in his reign Esar-haddon began the restoration of Babylon, which Sennacherib had destroyed. The temple of Esagila was restored and, of the city itself, Esar-haddon says: “Babylon I built anew, I enlarged, I raised aloft, I made magnificent.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">His records recount military operations against the <em>Gimirrai</em> or Cimmerians, believed to be the descendants of Gomer. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 10:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 38:6</a>.) He also sacked the city of Sidon, setting up a new city on a nearby site, which he named Kar—Esar-haddon. In one of his inscriptions he lists some twenty vassal kings, including Manasseh of Judah (<em>Menasi</em> king of <em>Yaudi</em>).</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:10-13</a> shows that Manasseh was captured by “the chiefs of the army that belonged to the king of Assyria” and taken to Babylon. In the past some have thought this reference to Babylon to be in error, considering Nineveh to be the place to which Manasseh would be taken. However, as has been seen, Esar-haddon, whose inscriptions show him to have been contemporaneous with Manasseh, had rebuilt Babylon and is said to have been “much less interested than any other Assyrian king in the embellishment of his capital, Nineveh.” (<em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,</em> Vol. 2, page 125) If it was during Esar-haddon’s reign that Manasseh was captured, there would be nothing incongruous about his being taken to Babylon, about whose restoration Esar-haddon so proudly boasted. It may be noted, however, that Esar-haddon’s son Ashurbanipal also makes reference to Manasseh as tributary during his reign.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>THE “SIXTY-FIVE YEARS”</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">At the time of the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem some of the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land referred to their having been brought to Palestine by “Esar-haddon the king of Assyria.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 4:2</a>) That the Assyrian transplantation of people to and from Palestine continued till his reign is viewed by some as a clue to the understanding of the period of “sixty-five years” stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:8</a> with regard to the desolation of Ephraim (with its capital at Samaria). The interval extending from the reign of Tiglath-pileser III (who initiated the deportation of people from the northern kingdom of Israel shortly after Isaiah’s prophecy) to that of Esar-haddon would allow for such a sixty-five-year period until the complete ‘shattering to pieces’ of Ephraim “so as not to be a people.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>CONQUEST OF EGYPT, AND ESAR-HADDON’S DEATH</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Esar-haddon’s outstanding military accomplishment was the conquest of Egypt, overcoming the Egyptian army under Ethiopian ruler Tirhakah (mentioned as the “king of Ethiopia” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Kings 19:9</a>) and taking the city of Memphis. Esar-haddon thus added to his many titles that of “King of the kings of Egypt.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Although Esar-haddon organized Egypt into districts and placed Assyrian governors over the princes of these districts, within a couple of years revolt developed. The Assyrian king set out on a second campaign to crush the rebellion, but died at Haran while on the way. In his inscriptions Esar-haddon had said: “I am powerful, I am all powerful. I am a hero, I am gigantic, I am colossal.” Yet, like all other imperfect humans, he was shown to be but an enslaved subject of the rule of Kings Sin and Death, who now claimed him.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 9:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Romans 5:21</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Before his death Esar-haddon had made arrangements to ensure a smooth succession to the throne by proclaiming his son Ashurbanipal as crown prince, while assigning another son, Shamash-shum-ukin, as king of Babylon. Thus, upon Esar-haddon’s death, Ashurbanipal became Assyria’s next monarch.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Num. 10:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 28:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 1 Sam. 20:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/23/4" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> 24</a>) On the fifteenth day of that month they kept God’s law by beginning the seven-day festival of the booths, the festival of the ingathering. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Lev. 23:33-43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Ex. 23:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 34:22</a>) These “holy conventions” were undoubtedly most joyful celebrations for the faithful remnant of Jews, along with their companions the Nethinim who had returned with them, and who served in connection with the altar by procuring wood and water.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezra 2:70</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE FOUNDATION LAID</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Now Jehovah’s prophecy had to come true concerning the temple: “You will have your foundation laid.” It did:</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="si">“And in the second year [536 B.C.E.] of their coming to the house of the true God at Jerusalem, in the second month [Ziv or Iyyar, the month in which King Solomon had begun building the first temple], Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jehozadak and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem started; and they now put in positions the Levites from twenty years of age upward to act as supervisors over the work of the house of Jehovah. . . . When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests in official clothing, with the trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, stood up to praise Jehovah according to the direction of David the king of Israel. . . . And many of the priests and the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses, the old men that had seen the former house [built by Solomon], were weeping with a loud voice at the laying of the foundation of this house before their eyes, while many others were raising the voice in shouting for joy.” This confusion of sounds was heard far away.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezra 3:8-13</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">But this work was not done without difficulty. Only clean, dedicated hands could have a share in rebuilding Jehovah’s house, so the people of the lands round about were denied a share in the work. They began to interfere with the building. They used every possible means to “frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia down till the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezra 4:1-5</a>) Finally they procured an edict from the king of Persia ordering the Jews to stop building. “It was then that the work on the house of God, which was in Jerusalem, stopped; and it continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezra 4:6-24</a>) This is, of course, not Darius the Mede, but King Darius I the Persian, who began ruling the empire in 522 B.C.E.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">In our next two issues we shall see that the enemies of God could not really thwart the rebuilding of the temple and of Jerusalem itself, also accurately timed by Jehovah. But the foregoing is sufficient to prove that the date 537 B.C.E. is a very important one. To Jehovah’s mind and likewise to the faithful remnant of Jews who returned from Babylon, it was important at that time. It is important to Bible students, for by means of it they can determine the length of time that man has been on the earth, the time of the flood of Noah’s day, of the making of the Abrahamic covenant, of the Exodus from Egypt, of the forty years’ wandering of Israel in the wilderness and of numerous other vitally important Bible events. It is important <em>to every one of us,</em> for by it we can corroborate the evidence of the physical facts taking place showing the end of the “seven times,” “the appointed times of the nations” and the establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ, in the heavens, in 1914 C.E.</p>

It was in the second year of the reign of the Persian king Darius Hystaspis, that is, in 520 B.C.E., that Haggai began to prophesy, and this encouraged the Jews to resume their temple building. At that, a letter was sent to Darius by the neighboring governors asking for a ruling on the matter; Darius revived the decree of Cyrus and supported the Jews against their enemies.</p>

This was in absolute fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy through Jeremiah. On the first day of their seventh month, Ethanim, the month in which they were to celebrate the day of atonement and the festival of booths, they assembled with their Jewish governor, Zerubbabel, and they joined with their high priest, Jeshua, in rebuilding the altar of Jehovah in the courtyard space on Mount Moriah. “So they established the altar firmly upon its own site.” Then the sacrifices to Jehovah were renewed, according to what was due each day. They even held their week-long festival of booths, the first in seventy years. Besides this there was the “constant burnt offering,” or the “continual burnt offering,” the burnt offering that was made daily, morning and evening. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ex. 29:38-42;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Num. 28:3-10</a>) Thus a start was made in the renewing of the worship of Jehovah at the very place where he had put his name. What a joyous time that was for the liberated remnant of his people! The temple foundation had not yet been laid, but that followed seven months later, in 536 B.C., during the reign of Cyrus the Great.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="41"><sup>41</sup></span> Again Jehovah’s word had marvelously come true.

In the days of the Jewish rebuilders of his temple according to Cyrus’ decree, the people of the lands round about resented the restoration of this remnant of Jehovah’s people and the re-establishment of his temple and worship. They did everything they could, locally and at the court of the Persian rulers, to hinder the rebuilding of Jehovah’s sanctuary, to “frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia down till the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 4:1-5</a>) The work on this second temple to Jehovah had actually been stopped under decree of a misinformed Persian king and by force of arms of the heathen opposers of Jehovah’s sanctuary. During this stoppage of temple building the Jews grew materialistic and Jehovah withheld his blessings. Then, to urge on his remnant of worshipers to carry through the main purpose for which he had brought about their release from Babylon, Jehovah raised up his prophets Haggai and Zechariah to point out their neglect and to build up their faith in Almighty God. Courageously, in the second year of Darius I, they resumed building Jehovah’s sanctuary. They refused to stop because of the objections of the enemy, and referred them to Jehovah’s decree through King Cyrus the Great. The sanctuary enemies appealed to King Darius I. The Persian king made investigation, proved the actuality of Cyrus’ decree for the Jews to rebuild Jehovah’s temple, and loyally ordered Cyrus’ decree to be enforced. So lay off from interfering, you foes of Jehovah’s house, or else be impaled on a stake and have your houses turned into public privies! In fact, lend Jehovah’s temple builders supplies in order to complete his house!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 6:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">43.

In a little more than four years it was completed. “They completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Adar [February-March], that is, in the sixth <span id="page154" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="154" data-before-text="154"></span>year of the reign of Darius the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a>) That was in the year 516 B.C. With joy Jehovah’s worshipers inaugurated his completed sanctuary. The next month, Nisan 14, they held the Passover. Temple services went forward in this sanctuary constructed by Governor Zerubbabel, as they had gone forward in the temple built by Solomon. Once again the daily sacrifice, or the “constant [continual] burnt offering,” was rendered up to Jehovah mornings and evenings. In 468 B.C., which was the seventh year of the Persian King Artaxerxes, the Jewish priest named Ezra, who was also a copyist of the law of God, went up from Babylon at the order of the king to this temple at Jerusalem for the purpose of bringing a large contribution that was made to the support of Jehovah’s sanctuary.

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Persian language is classed within the Indo-European family and gives evidence of being related to the Indian Sanskrit. At some time in their history the Persians began to make use of the cuneiform style of writing, with, however, a greatly reduced number of signs when compared with the hundreds of signs used in Babylonian and Assyrian cuneiform writing. Whereas during the rule of the Persian Empire some inscriptions are found in Old Persian with translations in Akkadian and in a language generally denominated “Elamite” or “Susian,” official documents used in the administration of the imperial territories were recorded primarily in Aramaic as an international language.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezr 4:7</a>.</p>

<strong>Art</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In dealing with the construction of the temple in King Solomon’s time, much comment has been made in reference works of the assumed lack of artistic skill on the part of the Israelites, to the point of giving practically all the credit to the Phoenicians. The record, however, shows that only one artisan was requested of the Phoenicians by Solomon, aside from the lumbermen employed in King Hiram’s own forests of Lebanon and the stone quarriers.

It is only during the second and third centuries C.E. that some paintings and sculptures appear in the catacombs attributed to nominal Christians. After the union of church and state in the fourth century, however, art began to be given a prominence that in time equaled that of the pagan religions and was often related to or in direct imitation of such religions, both in its symbolisms and its forms. Louis Réau, who held the chair of the History of Art of the Middle Ages at the Sorbonne University of France, demonstrates in his work <em>Iconographie de lʼArt Chrétien</em> (Vol. I, p. 10) that such paganism has long been recognized by historians of art and that the responsibility for it is to be placed, not merely on the artists, but on the policies that were followed by the church itself. He points out (p. 50) that, rather than really convert the pagans from their old practices and forms of worship, the church chose to respect “the ancestral customs and continue them under another name.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Thus, it is not surprising to find the signs of the zodiac, so prominent in ancient Babylon, displayed on cathedrals such as that of Notre Dame in Paris, where they appear on the left doorway and surround Mary in the huge centrally located rose window. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010388/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Isaiah 47:12-15</a>.) Similarly, a guidebook to the cathedral at Auxerre, also in France, states that in the central entrance to the cathedral, “the sculptor there mixed certain pagan heroes: an Eros [Greek god of love] nude and sleeping . . . a Hercules and a Satyr [one of the Greeks’ semihuman demigods]! The register at the lower right represents the parable of the Prodigal Son.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Similarly at the entrance of Saint Peter’s cathedral in Rome appear not only the figure of Christ and the “Virgin” but also that of Ganymede “carried off by the eagle” to become cupbearer of Zeus, king of the gods, and “Leda [who bore Castor and Pollux] fertilized by the swan” Zeus. Commenting further on such pagan influence, Réau asks: “But what is one to say then of the Final Judgment of the Sistine Chapel, the principal chapel of the Vatican, where one sees the nude Christ of Michelangelo lance the lightning like a thundering Jupiter [the Roman father of the gods] and the Damned cross the Styx [the river over which the Greeks believed the dead were ferried] in Charon’s barque?” As he states: “An example that came from so high [i.e., approved by the papacy] could not fail to be followed.”</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">In contrast with this, as has been seen, art was not given major attention by fleshly Israel and is virtually absent from the record of the early congregation of spiritual Israel of the first century C.E. It is, rather, in the field of literature that they surpassed all other peoples, being used by God to produce a work of superb beauty, not only in form but primarily in content: the Bible. Their inspired writings are “as apples of gold in silver carvings,” with crystal-clear truths of such brilliance as to rival the finest gems, and word pictures that convey visions and scenes of a grandeur and loveliness beyond the ability of human artists to portray.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010388/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Prov. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010388/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 3:13-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010388/32/2" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 4:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010388/32/3" data-bid="33-4" class="b"> 8:9, 10</a>; see SEAL.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Originally leading a somewhat austere, often nomadic life, the Persians manifested a great love for luxury and luxurious surroundings during the period of the empire. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 1:3-7</a>; also the clothing given to Mordecai, 8:15.) Sculptures at Persepolis represent the Persians as dressing with flowing, ankle-length robes, girded at the waist, and wearing low-laced shoes. By contrast, the Medes are depicted <span id="page1293" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1293" data-before-text="1293"></span>as wearing a tight, long-sleeved coat ending above the knee. Both Persians and Medes apparently made use of trousers, and Persian soldiers are shown as wearing sleeved tunics over iron-scaled armor, and trousers. They were expert horsemen and the cavalry played an important role in their war strategy.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Persian language is classed as within the Indo-European family and gives evidence of being related to the Indian Sanskrit. At some time in their history the Persians began to make use of the cuneiform style of writing, with, however, a greatly reduced number of signs as compared with the hundreds of signs used in Babylonian and Assyrian cuneiform writing. Whereas during the rule of the Persian Empire some inscriptions are found in Old Persian with translations in Akkadian and in a language generally denominated “Elamite” or “Susian,” official documents used in the administration of the imperial territories were recorded primarily in Aramaic as an international language.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 4:7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>DEVELOPMENT OF MEDO-PERSIAN EMPIRE</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Like the Medes, the Persians seem to have been ruled by several noble families. One of these families produced the Achaemenian dynasty of kings, the royal line from which came the founder of the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great. Cyrus, who, according to Herodotus and Xenophon, was born of a Persian father and a Median mother, united the Persians under his leadership. Till then the Medes had been dominant over the Persians but Cyrus gained a swift victory over Median King Astyages and captured his capital city of Ecbatana (550 B.C.E.). (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 8:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20</a>.) The Median Empire thus passed under the control of the Persians so that their boundaries now embraced all the Iranian plateau and stretched westward through Assyria and Armenia as far as the river Halys in Asia Minor.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Although the Medes continued subservient to the Persians during the remainder of the Achaemenian dynasty, there can be no doubt as to the dual nature of the empire that resulted. Thus, Professor Olmstead’s <em>History of the Persian Empire</em> (1948, p. 37) says: “The close relationship between Persians and Medes was never forgotten. Plundered Ecbatana remained a favorite royal residence. Medes were honored equally with Persians; they were employed in high office and were chosen to lead Persian armies. Foreigners spoke regularly of the Medes and Persians; when they used a single term, it was ‘the Mede.’”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Under Cyrus the Medo-Persian Empire expanded farther W, reaching to the Aegean Sea as a result of the Persian victory over King Croesus of Lydia and the subjugation of certain Greek coastal cities. His major conquest, however, came in 539 B.C.E. when, at the head of a combined force of Medes, Persians and Elamites, Cyrus took mighty Babylon, in fulfillment of the Biblical prophecies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 21:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 44:26–45:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Dan. 5:28</a>) With Babylon’s fall came the end of a long period of Semitic supremacy, now superseded by the first dominant world power of Aryan (Japhetic) descent. It also brought the land of Judah (as well as Syria and Phoenicia) within the Medo-Persian domain. By Cyrus’ decree in 537 B.C.E. the exiled Jews were allowed to return to their homeland, which had lain desolate for exactly seventy years.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:20-23</a>; see CYRUS.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong><em>Persian capitals</em></strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In keeping with the dual nature of the empire, a Mede named Darius became the ruler of the defeated Chaldean kingdom, though likely not independent from Cyrus’ suzerainty. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Dan. 5:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 9:1</a>; see DARIUS No. 1.) Babylon continued as a royal city of the Medo-Persian Empire, as well as a religious and commercial center. However, the torrid summers there generally seem to have been more than the Persian emperors wanted to endure, so Babylon seldom served as more than a winter location for them. There is archaeological evidence that, following the conquest of Babylon, Cyrus soon returned to Ecbatana (modern Hamadan), situated some 6,280 feet (1,914 meters) above sea level at the foot of Mount Elvend, where winters of heavy snow and bitter cold are balanced by delightful summers. It was at Ecbatana that Cyrus’ memorandum concerning the reconstruction of Jerusalem’s temple was found several years after its being issued. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezra 6:2-5</a>) The earlier Persian capital was at Pasargadae, some four hundred miles (643.6 kilometers) to the SE of Ecbatana, but at about the same altitude. Near Pasargadae, Persian emperors Darius, Xerxes and Artaxerxes later built the royal city of Persepolis, equipping it with a large network of underground tunnels, evidently to supply fresh water. A fourth capital was Susa (or Shushan) located near the Choaspes (Karkheh) River in ancient Elam, and occupying a strategic central location between Babylon, Ecbatana and Persepolis. Here Darius the Great built a magnificent palace that served generally as a winter residence, for, as at Babylon, the summer heat at Susa was extreme. However, as time progressed Susa became more and more the real administrative center of the empire.—See SHUSHAN.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>RELIGION AND LAW</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Persian rulers, while as capable of cruelty as the Semitic kings of Assyria and Babylonia, initially at least seem to have endeavored to manifest a degree of fairness and legality in their dealings with the conquered peoples. Their religion apparently contained some concept of ethics. Following their chief god <span id="page1294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1294" data-before-text="1294"></span>Ahura Mazda, a principal deity was Mithra, who became known, not only as a god of war, but also as the god of contracts, the one whose eyes and ears were ever alert to spy out any violator of an agreement. (See GODS AND GODDESSES.) Greek historian Herodotus wrote of the Persians: “Beginning from the age of five years to twenty, they instruct their sons in three things only—to ride, to use the bow, and to speak truth. . . . To tell a lie is considered by them the greatest disgrace.” (Book I, pars. 136-138) While the history of the Persian rulers shows them to be not above duplicity and intrigue, yet a basic adherence to some tribal creed of ‘keeping one’s word’ may be reflected in their insistence on the inviolability of the “law of the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Esther 1:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 8:8</a>) Thus, when Cyrus’ decree was found some seventeen years after its date of issuance, King Darius recognized the legality of the Jews’ position as regards the building of the temple and gave orders that full cooperation be extended to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-12</a>.</p>

<strong>Ascents</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At one time Jewish tradition held that these fifteen songs were sung by the Levites in ascending the fifteen steps from the Court of Women to the Court of Israel at the temple in Jerusalem, but this view is generally discounted today. Some suggest that the phrase refers to the exalted contents of these psalms, though there seems to be little reason thus to elevate them above the other inspired psalms. Most commentators believe the title derives from the use of these psalms by the Israelite worshipers when traveling or “ascending” to the lofty city of Jerusalem situated high in the mountains of Judah as they joyfully attended the three great annual festivals there.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What is the meaning of</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Mark 9:49, 50</strong></a> <strong>(<em>NW</em>): “For everyone must be salted with fire. Salt is fine; but if ever the salt loses its strength, with what will you mix it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace between one another”?—A. C., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Mosaic law required that sacrifices be seasoned with salt: “Every offering of your grain offering you will season with salt, and you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing upon your grain offering. Along with every offering of yours you will present salt.” Why? Salt is a preservative and prevents putrefaction. Two verses earlier the offering of anything fermented was forbidden. Salt with the sacrifice was to avoid any fermentation. Preventing change by decay, salt assured permanence, and was used in conjunction with a covenant to indicate the unchangeableness and permanence of the agreement, that the parties involved in the covenant were to be steadfast and faithful to its terms, not corrupting them: “All the holy contributions, which the sons of Israel will contribute to Jehovah, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as an allowance to time indefinite. It is a covenant of salt before Jehovah for you and your offering with you.” Also, “Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?” So salt symbolizes permanence and incorruptibility, and was offered with grain and meat offerings.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 2:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Num. 18:19</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:5</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 43:24</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Among ancient peoples it was a sign of friendship to eat salt together, and denoted perpetual fidelity and loyalty. This ancient view is reflected at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 4:14</a> (<em>AT</em>): “Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to behold the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king.” The one sacrificing on Jehovah’s altar was considered as a partaker with Jehovah; so the use of salt with the sacrifices indicated partaking of salt with him, which symbolized perpetual loyalty.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If the friendship was corrupted by disloyalty or impure conduct the symbolical salt was said to have lost its strength: “Salt, to be sure, is fine. But if even the salt loses its strength, with what will it be mixed? It is suitable neither for soil nor for manure. People throw it outside.” <em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible</em> says on page 525: “The impure salt of Syria, when exposed to the rain and sun or stored in damp houses, is apt to lose its taste and become useless. It cannot be used like much other refuse as a fertilizer, for it is good for nothing.” Because the true followers of Jesus, by example and by preaching, would be an influence to preserve from putrefaction and moral decay, Jesus called them “the salt of the earth.” He also called them “the light of the world.” Just as they were a light to dispel the darkness engulfing the world, so they were salt able to preserve the earth from corruption. But if they lost their spiritual strength they would be good for nothing and cast off: “If the salt loses its strength, how will its saltness be restored? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 14:34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 5:13, 14</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Having established that salt is a symbol of purity and incorruptibility, of permanence and steadfastness and loyalty, we now consider the text quoted in the question. “For everyone must be salted with fire.” Because of their erroneous belief in a fiery hell of torment, and because of the preceding verses, many Bible commentators say this means the wicked are permanently preserved in the fires of hell, though at the same time acknowledging the difficulties of such a view. Let us get the setting. Jesus is talking, not to the wicked, not to the general public, but privately to his disciples: “And if ever your hand makes you stumble, cut it off; it is finer for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go off into Gehenna, into the fire that cannot be put out. And if your foot makes you stumble, cut it off; it is finer for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be pitched into Gehenna. And if your eye makes you stumble, throw it away; it is finer for you to enter one-eyed into the kingdom of God, than with two eyes to be pitched into Gehenna, where their maggot does not die and the fire is not put out. For everyone must be salted with fire. Salt is fine; but if ever the salt loses its strength, with what will you mix it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace between one another.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 9:43-50</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Obviously this is figurative speech, not to be applied literally. Who will be so absurd as to <span id="page191" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span>say Jesus meant for his followers to chop off hands or feet or pluck out eyes? No hell-fire believer today applies this literally, cutting off his hand when it does something wrong or a foot when it strays or gouging out an eye if it looks in lust. We know the salt is symbolical. To be consistent, the fire must be also. In this figurative language Jesus was saying that if anything as dear as a hand or a foot or an eye interfered with faithful service, cut loose from it! Better to be without this dear thing and be pure and faithful and steadfast to Jehovah and enter the kingdom of heaven than to hold on to the cherished person or possession or practice and be destroyed, as symbolized by Gehenna, the valley outside Jerusalem where garbage and even bodies of criminals considered unworthy of a resurrection were thrown to be consumed by the fires kept burning there day and night, or to be disposed of by the maggots if out of reach of the flames. The fire symbolized everlasting destruction.</p>

<strong>Loyalty the Test</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span id="page571" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="571" data-before-text="571"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> True loyalty is shown by the three Hebrew children; and this clearly teaches that great though the distinction may be between king and subject yet such distinction is lost when collision occurs between loyalty and duty to Jehovah and obedience to men’s laws. These three men were obedient to law, and the law of obedience and loyalty to it was the first law. They had done nothing in defiance of the king, only refusing (and that not ostentatiously) compliance with a command that violated the right of conscience. Surely their abstinence because of conscience was not to the injury of others. They were not persuading others to do the same, though other Israelites were strengthened by their loyal adherence to God’s law. Their minds were decisive in the test and the ready answer was, “Be it known unto thee, O king.” These men were ‘rendering to Caesar what belonged to him’, and making sure Jehovah received what belonged to him. When Caesar arrogates to himself the things which are Jehovah’s, then his authority is to be resisted. God does not want Caesar’s things. With these men the issue was turn or burn, but true devotion and loyalty to Jehovah calms the spirit in critical times, and with exemplary calmness they gave their answer. In calmer days they had sworn to be faithful and loyal to God’s will, and now the test was on. They met it withstanding all the opposition, even the threat of the king, and the penalty of the fiery furnace. So today, do not let precious time slip away and then hope for the best under test. Know now and be personally convinced, so that when faced with any emergency you will know what to do. The right answer will then be given and you need not be ashamed, nor afraid, to own up to what you believe. Firm persuasion of the truth will deliver you from denying Jehovah and his Son.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>COVENANT OF SALT</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">19. What is the “covenant of salt”, and why was it made with David?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Eighteen years after the revolt in Israel, Jeroboam, king of Israel, warred against Abijah, king of Judah, and before the fight Abijah called to the rebel king, “Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952684/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:5, 6</a>, <em>AS</em>) What is the “covenant of salt”? Jehovah commanded, “And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952684/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Lev. 2:13</a>, <em>AS;</em> see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952684/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Numbers 18:19</a>.) Salt is a preservative from putrefaction and decay, and therefore speaks of purity and permanence. Its unalterable nature shows steadfastness and immutability. In olden times it is reported that to eat salt with another was a sign of hospitality and fidelity, a bond of perpetual friendship or pledge of fidelity. It was a pledge of loyalty. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952684/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezra 4:14</a>) Hence the covenant of salt Jehovah made with David would stand unbroken forever, and Abijah reminded this treacherous, disloyal king of the covenant, but to no avail. With an army twice as large, he attacked Abijah, but was defeated.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">20, 21. What did Jesus mean by the statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952684/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Mark 9:49, 50</a>?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> The Lord Jesus said, “For everyone must be salted with fire. Salt is fine; but if ever the salt loses its strength, with what will you mix it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace between one another.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952684/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Mark 9:49, 50</a>, <em>NW</em>) Without doubt the heat of persecution will not harm any who are loyal, and the testings and trials resulting from the presence of the great Judge will be for the purifying and cleansing of God’s people. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952684/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mal. 3:2-4</a>) If the spiritual salt is not there then there is corruption <span id="page572" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="572" data-before-text="572"></span>and decay. If in our sacrifice to Jehovah God we do not have fidelity, trustworthiness and loyalty then we are good for nothing. It is very necessary that we have confidence in our brothers that they will care for and be dependable in service. We must be at peace, but this is impossible unless we have loyalty, dependability and integrity ourselves. We must have ‘salt in ourselves’. It keeps us in the service, vigorous, quick, acceptable, thorough and with brotherly love.</p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Whatever the case, the reign of Cambyses ended in 522 B.C.E., and the rule that followed lasted seven months, ending also in 522 B.C.E. with the assassination of the usurper (either Bardiya or Gaumata the pseudo Smerdis). Yet during this brief rule apparently a second charge against the Jews was directed to the Persian throne, the king then being designated in the Bible as “Artaxerxes” (perhaps a throne name or title), and this time the accusations were successful in producing a royal ban against further construction on the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezr 4:7-23</a>) The temple work then lay idle “until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezr 4:24</a>.</p>

So these resentful rebuffed neighbors became adversaries and kept interfering with the temple rebuilding during all the rest of the reign of King Cyrus and the reigns of the succeeding kings of the Persian Empire down into the reign of King Darius Hystaspis the Persian. Before the reign of this Persian Darius I, those Palestinian adversaries succeeded in having the imperial ruler ban the work of rebuilding the temple of Jehovah by accusing the repatriated “sons of the Exile” of being seditionists.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972012/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 4:1-22</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> The Bible calls the Persian emperor who issued the ban by the name of Artaxerxes, and says: “Now after the copy of the official document of Artaxerxes the king had been read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in a hurry to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms.

This ban imposed by the Persian emperor, Artaxerxes, must have left the Jews in Jerusalem and Judah quite confused, in a quandary. They may have wondered how the ban of this later emperor could countermand the decree of King Cyrus the Great that was issued in 537 B.C.E. as part of the “law of the Medes and the Persians, which is not annulled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972012/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Daniel 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972012/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 12</a>) They did not think to put the matter to a test in the law courts of the Persian Empire, carrying the case even to the Supreme Court of the empire, to the court of last instance, which was with the emperor himself. The coming in of a new emperor, a successor to Artaxerxes, would allow for that. But who, now, would push the case? No one else but “Jehovah of armies” Himself.</p>

<strong>Why Highest Hopes Were Disappointed</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> At that time those repatriated Israelites were not saying: “The time has not come, the time of the house of Jehovah, for it to be built.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972012/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Haggai 1:2</a>) But soon there came opposition from the outside to those “sons of the Exile.” This was because the religiously purified Israelites would not let the outside pretending worshipers of Jehovah join with them in building the temple to the God of Israel. So these resentful rebuffed neighbors became adversaries and kept interfering with the temple rebuilding during all the rest of the reign of King Cyrus and the reigns of the succeeding kings of the Persian Empire down into the reign of King Darius Hystaspis the Persian. Before the reign of this Persian Darius I, those Palestinian adversaries succeeded in having the imperial ruler ban the work of rebuilding the temple of Jehovah by accusing the repatriated “sons of the Exile” of being seditionists.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972012/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 4:1-22</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> The Bible calls the Persian emperor who issued the ban by the name of Artaxerxes, and says: “Now after the copy of the official document of Artaxerxes the king had been read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in a hurry to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms.

<strong>Darius</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">It is particularly with regard to the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem that Darius Hystaspis figures in the Bible record. The temple foundation was laid in 536 B.C.E., but rebuilding work came under ban in 522 B.C.E. and “continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius” (520 B.C.E.). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001124/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezr 4:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001124/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 24</a>) During this year the prophets Haggai and Zechariah stirred up the Jews to renew the construction, and the work got under way again.

The letter advised him of the construction work, set forth the Jews’ claim for the legality of the project, and requested an investigation in the royal archives to see if there existed written evidence to substantiate that claim.

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Whatever the case, the reign of Cambyses ended in 522 B.C.E., and the rule that followed lasted seven months, ending also in 522 B.C.E. with the assassination of the usurper (either Bardiya or Gaumata the pseudo Smerdis). Yet during this brief rule apparently a second charge against the Jews was directed to the Persian throne, the king then being designated in the Bible as “Artaxerxes” (perhaps a throne name or title), and this time the accusations were successful in producing a royal ban against further construction on the temple.

<strong>Bible Book Number 37—Haggai</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Why did Jehovah commission Haggai? For this reason: In 537 B.C.E., Cyrus had issued the decree permitting the Jews to return to their homeland to rebuild the house of Jehovah. But it was now 520 B.C.E., and the temple was far from being completed. All these years the Jews had let enemy opposition along with their own apathy and materialism prevent them from realizing the very purpose of their return.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990098/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990098/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3:10-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990098/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 4:1-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990098/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Hag. 1:4</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 4.

It was in the second year of the reign of the Persian king Darius Hystaspis, that is, in 520 B.C.E., that Haggai began to prophesy, and this encouraged the Jews to resume their temple building. At that, a letter was sent to Darius by the neighboring governors asking for a ruling on the matter; Darius revived the decree of Cyrus and supported the Jews against their enemies.</p>

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To Jews who were looking for the coming of the Seed and who had faith in the Word of Jehovah God, it was certain that Jerusalem would not lie forever desolate but would again be rebuilt and would again flourish. They knew from Jeremiah’s prophecy that there was a seventy-year limit on Jerusalem’s desolation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 25:11, 12</a>) They knew of Jerusalem’s restoration and coming glory, from the prophecy of Isaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah, chapter 52</a>) They knew that when the Messiah came Jerusalem would have to be in existence, situated on Mount Zion, and that it must contain Jehovah’s temple of true worship. True, things looked bad at the time, for even the line of the royal family had been narrowed down very thin. All the sons of Zedekiah, Judah’s last king, were destroyed and only one of the reigning family, Jehoiachin or Jeconiah, Zedekiah’s nephew, survived. Similarly with the line of the high priest. Nebuchadnezzar put Seraiah to death but spared his son Jehozadak who, like Jeconiah, became captive in Babylon. But in this dark time the very survival of these two men and the fact that no foreign nation was allowed to settle in the land during Judah’s time of desolation served as strong signs to give bright hope to the faithful ones of the Jewish exiles. They could see that God was miraculously carrying out the preservation of the kingly and priestly lines and was also miraculously holding the land open until the time he would send his own people back to rebuild <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>Jerusalem. That the Messiah would come, not to a desolation, but to a rebuilt Jerusalem, was indicated in a remarkable prophecy at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a>: “And you should know and have the insight that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks. She will return and be actually rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in the straits of the times.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE BUILDING COMPLETED</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In our previous article we dealt with the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal line, accompanied by Jeshua the high priest, the son of Jehozadak. The return was by the decree of Cyrus the Persian, the conqueror of Babylon, as Jehovah had foretold. In 536 B.C.E. these returning Jews had the foundation of Jehovah’s temple laid. But shortly afterward the Devil set a roadblock in their way by causing the Samaritan enemies of the Jews to throw up an interference, eventually getting an official ban placed on the building work by the Persian government. This weakened the Jews so much that they left off this most important work and neglected the temple structure while they built homes for themselves. But even such opposition and the failure on the part of the Jewish remnant due to fear could not stop Jehovah’s purpose. He raised up the prophets Haggai and Zechariah who, with great zeal and a powerful message from God, stirred up the Jews to resume the temple building. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Zech. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Ezra 4:24-5:2</a>) It was during the second year of the reign of Darius I king of Persia, fifteen years after the foundation of the temple had been laid, that these prophets began to speak. Of course, the rebuilding work was quickly noticed by the enemy and the lawfulness of their activity was brought in question before the Persian-appointed officials governing the provinces between the Euphrates River and the Mediterranean Sea. But now the Jews, inspired by Haggai and Zechariah, were fearless and continued their work. They called attention to the fact that Cyrus had made the decree that the temple should be rebuilt. Thereupon, Tattenai the governor, to whom Zerubbabel was responsible, and other officials wrote to the king of Persia for his decision. Ezra the scribe reports the results:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“It was then that Darius the king put an order through, and they made an investigation in the house of the records of the treasures deposited there in Babylon. And at Ecbatana, in the fortified place that was in the jurisdictional district of Media, there was found a scroll [not a cuneiform tablet], and the memorandum to this effect was written within it: ‘In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king put an order through concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt as the place where they are to offer sacrifices, and its foundations are to be fixed, its height being sixty cubits, its width sixty cubits, with three layers of stones rolled into place and one layer of timbers; and let the expense be given from the king’s house. And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God that Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon be returned, that they may reach the temple that is in Jerusalem at its place and be deposited in the house of God.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Darius recognized the building work as lawful and strictly told the officials: “Keep your distance from there. Let the work on that house of God alone.” Furthermore, he warned that, “as for anybody that violates this decree, a timber will be pulled out of his house and he will be impaled upon it, and his house will be turned into a public privy on this account.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 6:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Encouraged by so manifest a blessing from God, the Jews hastened the work and in less than four and one half years’ time the temple was completed. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a> gives <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>the date of completion, saying: “And they completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Adar, that is, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.” If the first year of Darius I is counted from 522 B.C.E., when his predecessor Cambyses died, then the rebuilding of the temple was completed in March of 516 B.C.E.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965723/0">a</a></p>

When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests in official clothing, with the trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, stood up to praise Jehovah according to the direction of David the king of Israel. . . . And many of the priests and the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses, the old men that had seen the former house [built by Solomon], were weeping with a loud voice at the laying of the foundation of this house before their eyes, while many others were raising the voice in shouting for joy.” This confusion of sounds was heard far away.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezra 3:8-13</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">But this work was not done without difficulty.

But the foregoing is sufficient to prove that the date 537 B.C.E. is a very important one. To Jehovah’s mind and likewise to the faithful remnant of Jews who returned from Babylon, it was important at that time. It is important to Bible students, for by means of it they can determine the length of time that man has been on the earth, the time of the flood of Noah’s day, of the making of the Abrahamic covenant, of the Exodus from Egypt, of the forty years’ wandering of Israel in the wilderness and of numerous other vitally important Bible events. It is important <em>to every one of us,</em> for by it we can corroborate the evidence of the physical facts taking place showing the end of the “seven times,” “the appointed times of the nations” and the establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ, in the heavens, in 1914 C.E.</p>

<strong>Darius</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Following the death of Cambyses II, who died about 522 B.C.E. while returning from Egypt, the Persian throne was occupied for a short time by Gaumata (or Bardiya). Darius, with the aid of six other Persian nobles, slew Gaumata and gained the throne, the account of this being set forth in three languages in the immense Behistun Inscription that Darius had carved on sheer cliffs facing a plain through which ran the principal caravan route from Baghdad to Teheran. According to the inscription Gaumata was a usurper, posing as Cambyses’ brother who had been put to death. Most modern authorities accept this account (which is laced with repeated assurances by Darius that “it is true and not lies”) as basically factual, while some believe that Darius was a “monumental liar” and that the evidence indicates him to be the actual usurper. Whatever the case, Darius was faced with an empire in revolt upon assuming the kingship and is considered as having spent the next two years in subduing the insurrectionary elements throughout the realm. Egypt, which had thrown off the Persian yoke, was reconquered by Darius about 519-518 B.C.E. Thereafter he extended the imperial borders into India in the E and into Thrace and Macedonia in the W. He is noted as well for his <span id="page422" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="422" data-before-text="422"></span>efficient reorganization of the administrative structure throughout the empire, the formation of an imperial law code, called the “Ordinance of Good Regulations,” and for having reopened the canal connecting the Nile River of Egypt with the Red Sea.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">It is particularly with regard to the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem that Darius Hystaspis figures in the Bible record. The temple work had begun in 537 B.C.E. but about 522 it came under ban and “continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius” (520/519). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezra 4:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 24</a>) During this year the prophets Haggai and Zechariah stirred up the Jews to renew the construction and the work got under way again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezra 5:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Zech. 1:1</a>) This provoked an inquiry and the sending of a letter to Persian King Darius by Tattenai, the governor representing the imperial interests in the region W of the Euphrates, and other officials, advising him of the construction work, setting forth the Jews’ claim for the legality of the project, and requesting an investigation in the royal archives to see if there existed written evidence to substantiate that claim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezra 5:3-17</a>) The Jewish declaration that contrasted the actions of the Chaldean Nebuchadnezzar, as the destroyer of the temple, with the Persian Cyrus, as the one authorizing its reconstruction, should have had an appropriate and felicitous effect on Darius since, in the first years of his reign, he had to overcome two revolts by rebels each taking the name Nebuchadnezzar (called Nebuchadnezzar III and Nebuchadnezzar IV by historians), claiming to be sons of Nabonidus, and endeavoring to make Babylon independent of the Persian Empire.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The official search of records in the archives at Ecbatana, the ancient Median capital, uncovered the document by Cyrus. Darius thereupon sent orders to Governor Tattenai that he and the other officials should not only refrain from interfering with the temple work but also provide building funds from the “royal treasury of the tax beyond the River,” as well as animals and other necessary supplies for the sacrificial offerings. Anyone violating the king’s order was to be impaled on a stake and his house “turned into a public privy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-12</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">With this official cooperation, and with continued prophetical encouragement (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Zech. 7:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 8:1-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 20-23</a>), the temple work went on to successful completion by the “sixth year of the reign of Darius” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ezra 6:13-15</a>; probably by March 5/6 of 515 B.C.E.). Since Darius’ inscriptions show him to be a devoted worshiper of Ahura Mazda, it is evident that his action, though serving Jehovah God’s purpose and doubtless having his direction, was basically done out of respect for the irrevocable nature of the Medo-Persian laws and in harmony with a policy of tolerance by Darius’ government, evidence for which tolerance is found in some of his inscriptions.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong>LATER CAMPAIGNS IN GREECE</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Toward the turn of the century, various Greek cities of Ionia revolted against Persian domination and, though their revolt was quelled, Darius determined to punish Athens and Eretria for their having rendered aid to the rebellious cities. This led to a Persian invasion of Greece, resulting, however, in defeat of Darius’ forces at the battle of Marathon in 490 B.C.E. Though Darius made careful preparations for a further Grecian campaign, he was unable to carry it out before his death in 486 B.C.E. He was succeeded by his son Xerxes.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">3. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Nehemiah 12:22</a> mentions the recording of Levitical heads of paternal houses “in the days of Eliashib, Joiada and Johanan and Jaddua . . . down till the kingship of Darius the Persian.” Since Eliashib was high priest at the time of Nehemiah’s return to Jerusalem (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1</a>) and since by the time of Nehemiah’s second visit to that city (during or following the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes [c. 443 B.C.E.]) Joiada had a married son (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Neh. 13:28</a>), it is likely that the “Darius” mentioned was Darius II, Ochus (also called Nothus, the “illegitimate son” of Artaxerxes I), who ruled from 423 to 404 B.C.E.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">A letter found among the Elephantine Papyri, reckoned as dating from the last years of the fifth century B.C.E., makes reference to “Johanan” as high priest at Jerusalem at that time.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">4. Darius III (surnamed Codomannus), the last king of the Persian Empire. He became king in 336 B.C.E., the same year Alexander the Great was crowned king of Macedonia. Though Darius III is not mentioned directly in the Bible account, he, as the head of the Persian Empire, experienced the fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy concerning the two-horned ram (representing Medo-Persia) and the powerful he-goat (representing the Grecian kingdom). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Dan. 8:2-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>) Darius III was able to effect the reconquest of Egypt, but when he later (334 B.C.E.) marched against the swiftly advancing forces of Alexander he met defeat at the Granicus River in the northwestern corner of Asia Minor. The Persian forces withdrew and prepared for another attempt at halting Alexander’s advances, this time engaging the Greek forces on the narrow plain of Issus, at the point where Asia Minor and Syria join. Again Alexander routed the Persians and, two years later (331), the final battle was fought at Gaugamela, not far from the ruins of ancient Nineveh on the Tigris River. Utterly defeated, Darius took flight but was murdered by a satrap of the Persian Empire in the year 330 B.C.E. Thus, the Medo-Persian Empire had “no deliverer out of its [the symbolic he-goat’s] hand.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Dan. 8:7</a>; see PERSIA, PERSIANS.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Why Christians Shun Tobacco</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Many different methods for breaking the tobacco habit <span id="page61" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span>are recommended by worldly theorists, such as special diets, exercise, medicines, gradual tapering-off of smoking, etc. The best method for quitting is to have a good incentive for doing so and then to stop abruptly. It is the method used by many when they became Jehovah’s witnesses and wanted to cease fouling themselves with tobacco. Many of this multitude of witnesses numbering into the tens of thousands were at one time in slavery to tobacco with the rest of the world, but they broke free of its unclean bonds, not because they followed a special diet or course of exercise, but because they realized that it was defiling their bodies and harming their health and making them unclean for Jehovah’s service. Had they not learned that Jehovah’s witnesses were commanded to be clean in both mind and body?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950123/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 52:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950123/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 7:1</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">How, then, were so many thousands able to break the tobacco habit? Most people fail to appreciate that the mind is the agency that controls, governs and directs the body and its habits. But Jehovah’s witnesses fully realize this and know that the battle against tobacco must be fought and won in the mind. They know full well that the great adversary the Devil as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour attacks one’s mind, and so they take mental refuge under the protecting hand of Jehovah God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950123/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:8</a>) Under such overshadowing protection they are taught by God’s Word, the Bible. But in addition to a mind fed, strengthened and directed by God’s Word he gives them that all-necessary invisible force or energy toward righteousness, and that is his holy spirit. To those who ask him persistently he gives this spirit more readily than earthly parents give good gifts to beloved children. Thus, fortified and moved by his holy spirit, and with honest-to-goodness appeal or prayer to God for his help to overcome the entrenched habit, they are bound to vindicate his power in gaining the victory.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Food and exercise are also important factors for Jehovah’s witnesses. Their special diet is that prescribed by the great Physician: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950123/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>) They do not get choosy and stubbornly reject the spiritual food that puts their unclean habits in an unfavorable light, but partake of the spiritual food to get strength to overcome the uncleanness. For exercise they have their “feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950123/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 6:15</a>), and they hasten from house to house with this good news. They do not sit around in a tobacco-laden atmosphere, but get out into the fresh air and occupy their mind and body by standing on the street corners with magazines heralding forth the Kingdom message.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">This, then, is the sure and positive cure for the tobacco habit, and anyone who will make a clean and abrupt break from the snare and follow this course will find that in a short time he will have lost his desire for the weed. Then he will have more health and strength and energy to expend in Jehovah’s service. He will have redeemed time and money for worth-while uses. He will have Scripturally cleansed himself from that particular “filthiness of the flesh”. Then, instead of tearing down the organization’s reputation for cleanness, he will be a clean associate of the clean organization that today is preaching the good news of Jehovah God’s righteous new world of endless blessings.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"></p>

It was exactly two lunar months since the day that Haggai was inspired to give his final prophecies​—to the Aaronic priests and to Governor Zerubbabel. That was on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month (Chislev), which was toward the beginning of the year 519 B.C.E. On that memorable day of Jerusalem’s history, work had been taken up again at the foundation of the temple on Mount Moriah, just north of Mount Zion. Before another inspired message came to the Jewish builders from their God, they worked unceasingly at the sacred building site, for two whole months. This time they did not let any attempts at interference by enemies stop them.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu"> 2.

Hence considerable time would be required for King Darius to get the startling information. Persian officials of provinces lying beyond (westward of) the Euphrates River from the king in Persia, reasonably, would get the news earlier. This is evidently what happened. The discussions that followed and the investigations that were launched must have occupied months (four or five months, according to some estimates) before a decision by King Darius on the matter in dispute could be received and enforced.

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To Jews who were looking for the coming of the Seed and who had faith in the Word of Jehovah God, it was certain that Jerusalem would not lie forever desolate but would again be rebuilt and would again flourish. They knew from Jeremiah’s prophecy that there was a seventy-year limit on Jerusalem’s desolation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 25:11, 12</a>) They knew of Jerusalem’s restoration and coming glory, from the prophecy of Isaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah, chapter 52</a>) They knew that when the Messiah came Jerusalem would have to be in existence, situated on Mount Zion, and that it must contain Jehovah’s temple of true worship. True, things looked bad at the time, for even the line of the royal family had been narrowed down very thin. All the sons of Zedekiah, Judah’s last king, were destroyed and only one of the reigning family, Jehoiachin or Jeconiah, Zedekiah’s nephew, survived. Similarly with the line of the high priest. Nebuchadnezzar put Seraiah to death but spared his son Jehozadak who, like Jeconiah, became captive in Babylon. But in this dark time the very survival of these two men and the fact that no foreign nation was allowed to settle in the land during Judah’s time of desolation served as strong signs to give bright hope to the faithful ones of the Jewish exiles. They could see that God was miraculously carrying out the preservation of the kingly and priestly lines and was also miraculously holding the land open until the time he would send his own people back to rebuild <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>Jerusalem. That the Messiah would come, not to a desolation, but to a rebuilt Jerusalem, was indicated in a remarkable prophecy at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a>: “And you should know and have the insight that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks. She will return and be actually rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in the straits of the times.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE BUILDING COMPLETED</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In our previous article we dealt with the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal line, accompanied by Jeshua the high priest, the son of Jehozadak. The return was by the decree of Cyrus the Persian, the conqueror of Babylon, as Jehovah had foretold. In 536 B.C.E. these returning Jews had the foundation of Jehovah’s temple laid. But shortly afterward the Devil set a roadblock in their way by causing the Samaritan enemies of the Jews to throw up an interference, eventually getting an official ban placed on the building work by the Persian government. This weakened the Jews so much that they left off this most important work and neglected the temple structure while they built homes for themselves. But even such opposition and the failure on the part of the Jewish remnant due to fear could not stop Jehovah’s purpose. He raised up the prophets Haggai and Zechariah who, with great zeal and a powerful message from God, stirred up the Jews to resume the temple building. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Zech. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Ezra 4:24-5:2</a>) It was during the second year of the reign of Darius I king of Persia, fifteen years after the foundation of the temple had been laid, that these prophets began to speak. Of course, the rebuilding work was quickly noticed by the enemy and the lawfulness of their activity was brought in question before the Persian-appointed officials governing the provinces between the Euphrates River and the Mediterranean Sea. But now the Jews, inspired by Haggai and Zechariah, were fearless and continued their work. They called attention to the fact that Cyrus had made the decree that the temple should be rebuilt. Thereupon, Tattenai the governor, to whom Zerubbabel was responsible, and other officials wrote to the king of Persia for his decision. Ezra the scribe reports the results:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“It was then that Darius the king put an order through, and they made an investigation in the house of the records of the treasures deposited there in Babylon. And at Ecbatana, in the fortified place that was in the jurisdictional district of Media, there was found a scroll [not a cuneiform tablet], and the memorandum to this effect was written within it: ‘In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king put an order through concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt as the place where they are to offer sacrifices, and its foundations are to be fixed, its height being sixty cubits, its width sixty cubits, with three layers of stones rolled into place and one layer of timbers; and let the expense be given from the king’s house. And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God that Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon be returned, that they may reach the temple that is in Jerusalem at its place and be deposited in the house of God.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Darius recognized the building work as lawful and strictly told the officials: “Keep your distance from there. Let the work on that house of God alone.” Furthermore, he warned that, “as for anybody that violates this decree, a timber will be pulled out of his house and he will be impaled upon it, and his house will be turned into a public privy on this account.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 6:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Encouraged by so manifest a blessing from God, the Jews hastened the work and in less than four and one half years’ time the temple was completed. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a> gives <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>the date of completion, saying: “And they completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Adar, that is, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.” If the first year of Darius I is counted from 522 B.C.E., when his predecessor Cambyses died, then the rebuilding of the temple was completed in March of 516 B.C.E.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965723/0">a</a></p>

And he took off his prison garments; and he ate bread constantly before him all the days of his life.” Jehoiachin (or Jeconiah) had seven sons in Babylonia, including Shealtiel, whose nominal son Zerubbabel became governor of rebuilt Jerusalem, and through whose line of descent Jesus Christ came.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965005/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Chron. 3:17-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965005/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965005/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 2:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965005/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Ezra 5:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965005/6/4" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> Matt. 1:12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Evil-merodach reigned two years and was murdered by his brother-in-law Neriglissar, who reigned for four years, which time he spent mainly in building operations. His underage son Labashi-Marduk, a vicious boy, succeeded him, and was assassinated within nine months. Nabonidus, who had served as governor of Babylon and who had been Nebuchadnezzar’s favorite son-in-law, took the throne and had a fairly glorious reign until Babylon fell in 539 B.C.E. He devoted his time to literature, art and religion. He is reported to have been the son of a priestess of the moon at Harran (Haran), which fact had endeared him to Nebuchadnezzar. Says <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> Volume 2, page 441:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">He was an enthusiastic religionist and antiquarian. He built and rebuilt many temples in the principal cities of his kingdom. Nabonidus’ enthusiasm carried him too far, for he attempted to centralize in Babylon the religion of the kingdom. In doing this he alienated the priesthood, and even aroused their active opposition. For throughout the history of Babylonia each city had its own patron deity, to which its temple was dedicated and its people devoted. The images and shrines of these various divinities were collected to Babylon. This act, with others of similar offense to the priests, paved the way for his downfall before a mightier power.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Nabonidus set up a second capital for Babylonia at the oasis of Tema in Arabia. In the third year of his reign he made Belshazzar coregent. While Nabonidus was absent from Babylon and down south in Tema, Belshazzar officiated in Babylon as second ruler of the land. Belshazzar was also very religious, a thing required by the Babylonians of their kings. He reverenced the Babylonian gods greatly, but insulted and blasphemed Jehovah, rejoicing over the supposed victory of his gods in the fact that the Jews were in captivity to Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965005/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 5:1-4</a>) He built sanctuaries, making offerings of gold and silver <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>and sacrificial animals. There are six cuneiform texts that have been discovered that run from the fifth year to the thirteenth year of the reign of his father Nabonidus that prove this fact. Belshazzar even paid the Babylonian religious tithe. He was a devotee of the gods.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965005/1">b</a></p>

In 2014 an article in the magazine <em>Biblical Archaeology Review</em> addressed the question: “How many people in the Hebrew Bible have been confirmed archaeologically?” The answer given: “At least 50!” One man who did not make the list in that article was Tattenai. Who was he? Let us review his brief role in the Bible record.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jerusalem was once part of a vast Persian Empire. The city lay in an area that the Persians called Across-the-River, that is, to the west of the Euphrates. After conquering Babylonia, the Persians released Jewish captives and authorized them to rebuild Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017087/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) Enemies of the Jews, however, opposed the project and used it as a pretext to accuse the Jews of rebelling against Persia. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017087/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 4:4-16</a>) During the reign of Darius I (522-486 B.C.E.), a Persian official named Tattenai led an inquiry into the matter. The Bible calls him “the governor of the region Beyond the River.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017087/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 5:3-7</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A number of cuneiform tablets bearing the name Tattenai have survived as part of what may have been a family archive. The tablet that links one member of this family to the Bible character is a promissory note dated to the 20th year of Darius I, 502 B.C.E. It identifies a witness to the transaction as a servant of “Tattannu, governor of Across-the-River”​—the same Tattenai who appears in the Bible book of Ezra.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What was this man’s role? In 535 B.C.E., Cyrus the Great reorganized his dominions into provinces, one of which was called Babylon and Across-the-River. The province was later split into two parts, one of which was simply called Across-the-River. It included Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, Samaria, and Judah and was likely ruled from Damascus. Tattenai governed this region from about 520 to 502 B.C.E.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">After traveling to Jerusalem to investigate the accusation of rebellion, Tattenai reported to Darius that the Jews claimed to have received authorization from Cyrus to rebuild Jehovah’s temple. Investigations in the royal archives substantiated that claim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017087/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 5:6, 7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017087/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017087/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 6:1-3</a>) So Tattenai was ordered not to interfere, and he obeyed.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017087/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 6:6, 7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017087/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">To be sure, “Tattenai the governor of the region Beyond the River” merits only a footnote in history. Note, though, that the Scriptures mention him and apply to him exactly the <em>right</em> title. That fact gives us yet another bit of evidence that archaeology repeatedly supports the Bible’s historical accuracy.</p>

However, consider a situation that faced some Jewish elders in the days of Ezra.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Following the return of the Jewish remnant from Babylon, a 16-year-long period of inactivity set in. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah managed to shake the Jews out of their apathy, and the work of rebuilding Jehovah’s temple was resumed. Soon, though, this work was challenged by Persian officials. “Who put an order through to you to build this house?” asked the opposers.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986089/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 5:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The reply to this inquiry was critical. If the elders allowed themselves to be intimidated, the temple restoration would abruptly come to a halt. If the elders antagonized these officials, an immediate ban on the work could be imposed. So the elders (doubtless led by Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua) phrased a tactful but effective reply. They reminded the officials of the long-forgotten decree of Cyrus that had granted the Jews royal permission to go forward with this work. Knowing the Persian policy of never altering stated law, these officials shrewdly chose to avoid opposing a royal decree. The work was thus allowed to continue until King Darius later gave his official go-ahead!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986089/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 5:11-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986089/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Was this astounding result due to human wisdom? On the contrary, Ezra’s account says that “the eye of their God proved to be upon the older men of the Jews.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986089/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 5:5</a>) Clearly, Jehovah directed both their reply and the favorable response from the Persian king. Christian elders today can likewise look to Jehovah for guidance and direction when facing difficult decisions or dealing with opposers. Assures Jehovah at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986089/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8</a>: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

Yet, they do not believe that Bible accounts are accurate history, so they deny that it is the Word of God. There is, though, ample evidence of the Bible’s accuracy. This coin (enlarged view) is a good example. What does the writing say?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The coin was made in Tarsus, a city in the southeastern part of what is now Turkey. The coin was produced during the rule of the Persian governor Mazaeus in the fourth century B.C.E.

At issue was the Jews’ rebuilding of their temple in Jerusalem. Ezra was a skilled copyist of God’s Law, and you would expect him to be precise, accurate in what he wrote. You will see at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993449/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 5:6</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993449/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">6:13</a> that he termed Tattenai “the governor beyond the River.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Ezra penned that about 460 B.C.E., some 100 years before this coin was minted. Oh, some people might feel that the designation for an ancient official is a minor detail.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972018/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 3:13-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972018/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972018/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 14</a>) From Jerusalem by way of the “fertile crescent” over to Shushan would be over a thousand miles, and from Shushan up to Ecbatana to the north would be more than two hundred <span id="page125" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="125" data-before-text="125"></span>miles, if the roads were straight. Hence considerable time would be required for King Darius to get the startling information. Persian officials of provinces lying beyond (westward of) the Euphrates River from the king in Persia, reasonably, would get the news earlier. This is evidently what happened. The discussions that followed and the investigations that were launched must have occupied months (four or five months, according to some estimates) before a decision by King Darius on the matter in dispute could be received and enforced. Here is what took place, as recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101972018/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 5:2 to 6:2</a>:</p>

<strong>Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadrezzar</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><span id="page1213" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1213" data-before-text="1213"></span><strong>BUILDING PROJECTS</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Besides attaining numerous military victories and expanding the Babylonian Empire in fulfillment of prophecy (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jeremiah chaps. 47-49</a>), Nebuchadnezzar engaged in considerable building activity. To satisfy the homesick longings of his Median queen, Nebuchadnezzar reportedly built the Hanging Gardens, rated as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Many of the extant cuneiform inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar tell of his building projects, including his erection of temples, palaces and walls. An excerpt from one of these inscriptions reads:</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">“Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, the restorer of Esagila and Ezida, son of Nabopolassar am I. As a protection to Esagila, that no powerful enemy and destroyer might take Babylon, that the line of battle might not approach lmgur-Bel, the wall of Babylon, that which no former king had done [I did]; at the enclosure of Babylon I made an enclosure of a strong wall on the east side. I dug a moat, I reached the level of the water. I then saw that the wall which my father had prepared was too small in its construction. I built with bitumen and brick a mighty wall which, like a mountain, could not be moved and connected it with the wall of my father; I laid its foundations on the breast of the under-world; its top I raised up like a mountain. Along this wall to strengthen it I constructed a third and as the base of a protecting wall I laid a foundation of bricks and built it on the breast of the under-world and laid its foundation. The fortifications of Esagila and Babylon I strengthened and established the name of my reign forever.”—<em>Archaeology and the Bible,</em> by George A. Barton, pp. 478, 479.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>HIS INSANITY</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The foregoing harmonizes with Nebuchadnezzar’s boast made just before he lost his sanity: “Is not this Babylon the Great, that I myself have built for the royal house with the strength of my might and for the dignity of my majesty?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Dan. 4:30</a>) But when, in fulfillment of his divinely sent dream about the chopped-down tree, his reasoning powers were restored, Nebuchadnezzar had to acknowledge that Jehovah is able to humiliate those walking in pride.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Dan. chap. 4</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>VERY RELIGIOUS</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The indications are that Nebuchadnezzar was extremely religious, building and beautifying the temples of numerous Babylonian deities. Particularly was he devoted to the worship of Marduk, the chief god of Babylon. To him Nebuchadnezzar gave credit for his military victories. Trophies of war, including the sacred vessels of Jehovah’s temple, appear to have been deposited in the temple of Marduk (Merodach). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezra 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 5:14</a>) Says an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar: “For thy glory, O exalted MERODACH a house have I made. . . . May it receive within itself the abundant tribute of the Kings of nations and of all peoples!”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The image of gold set up by Nebuchadnezzar in the plain of Dura was perhaps dedicated to Marduk and designed to promote religious unity in the empire. Enraged over the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to worship this image even after being given a second opportunity, Nebuchadnezzar commanded that they be thrown into a fiery furnace heated seven times hotter than usual. However, when these three Hebrews were delivered by Jehovah’s angel, Nebuchadnezzar was forced to say that “there does not exist another god that is able to deliver like this one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Dan. chap. 3</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Nebuchadnezzar also appears to have relied heavily on divination in planning his military moves. Ezekiel’s prophecy, for example, depicts the king of Babylon as employing divination in deciding whether to go against Rabbah of Ammon or against Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:18-23</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Aside from the royal proclamation quoted in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>, the Biblical record speaks of another document by Cyrus, a “memorandum,” which was filed away in the house of the records at Ecbatana in Media and was discovered there during the reign of Darius the Persian.

It was never intended for publication but solely for the eye of the proper official, following which it was filed away in government archives.”​—<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 203.</p>

This form of the name corresponds to the reading of the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> and is also found in the Greek text of the Apocryphal writings that came to be included in the <em>Septuagint</em>. The Masoretic text and the Syriac <em>Peshitta,</em> however, give the name as “Achmetha.” Early Greek writers seem to have applied the name Ecbatana to several places. However, there is general agreement among scholars today that the Ecbatana captured by Cyrus (and thus that mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001254/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezr 6:2</a>) is the modern city of Hamadan, an important commercial center of Iran situated at the foot of Mount Alwand approximately 290 km (180 mi) WSW of Tehran. Just as ancient Ecbatana was a significant city along the chief route leading from Mesopotamia to points farther E, so modern Hamadan is traversed by various roads, such as that running from Baghdad to Tehran.</p>

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To Jews who were looking for the coming of the Seed and who had faith in the Word of Jehovah God, it was certain that Jerusalem would not lie forever desolate but would again be rebuilt and would again flourish. They knew from Jeremiah’s prophecy that there was a seventy-year limit on Jerusalem’s desolation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 25:11, 12</a>) They knew of Jerusalem’s restoration and coming glory, from the prophecy of Isaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah, chapter 52</a>) They knew that when the Messiah came Jerusalem would have to be in existence, situated on Mount Zion, and that it must contain Jehovah’s temple of true worship. True, things looked bad at the time, for even the line of the royal family had been narrowed down very thin. All the sons of Zedekiah, Judah’s last king, were destroyed and only one of the reigning family, Jehoiachin or Jeconiah, Zedekiah’s nephew, survived. Similarly with the line of the high priest. Nebuchadnezzar put Seraiah to death but spared his son Jehozadak who, like Jeconiah, became captive in Babylon. But in this dark time the very survival of these two men and the fact that no foreign nation was allowed to settle in the land during Judah’s time of desolation served as strong signs to give bright hope to the faithful ones of the Jewish exiles. They could see that God was miraculously carrying out the preservation of the kingly and priestly lines and was also miraculously holding the land open until the time he would send his own people back to rebuild <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>Jerusalem. That the Messiah would come, not to a desolation, but to a rebuilt Jerusalem, was indicated in a remarkable prophecy at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a>: “And you should know and have the insight that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks. She will return and be actually rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in the straits of the times.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE BUILDING COMPLETED</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In our previous article we dealt with the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal line, accompanied by Jeshua the high priest, the son of Jehozadak. The return was by the decree of Cyrus the Persian, the conqueror of Babylon, as Jehovah had foretold. In 536 B.C.E. these returning Jews had the foundation of Jehovah’s temple laid. But shortly afterward the Devil set a roadblock in their way by causing the Samaritan enemies of the Jews to throw up an interference, eventually getting an official ban placed on the building work by the Persian government. This weakened the Jews so much that they left off this most important work and neglected the temple structure while they built homes for themselves. But even such opposition and the failure on the part of the Jewish remnant due to fear could not stop Jehovah’s purpose. He raised up the prophets Haggai and Zechariah who, with great zeal and a powerful message from God, stirred up the Jews to resume the temple building. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Zech. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Ezra 4:24-5:2</a>) It was during the second year of the reign of Darius I king of Persia, fifteen years after the foundation of the temple had been laid, that these prophets began to speak. Of course, the rebuilding work was quickly noticed by the enemy and the lawfulness of their activity was brought in question before the Persian-appointed officials governing the provinces between the Euphrates River and the Mediterranean Sea. But now the Jews, inspired by Haggai and Zechariah, were fearless and continued their work. They called attention to the fact that Cyrus had made the decree that the temple should be rebuilt. Thereupon, Tattenai the governor, to whom Zerubbabel was responsible, and other officials wrote to the king of Persia for his decision. Ezra the scribe reports the results:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“It was then that Darius the king put an order through, and they made an investigation in the house of the records of the treasures deposited there in Babylon. And at Ecbatana, in the fortified place that was in the jurisdictional district of Media, there was found a scroll [not a cuneiform tablet], and the memorandum to this effect was written within it: ‘In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king put an order through concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt as the place where they are to offer sacrifices, and its foundations are to be fixed, its height being sixty cubits, its width sixty cubits, with three layers of stones rolled into place and one layer of timbers; and let the expense be given from the king’s house. And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God that Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon be returned, that they may reach the temple that is in Jerusalem at its place and be deposited in the house of God.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Darius recognized the building work as lawful and strictly told the officials: “Keep your distance from there. Let the work on that house of God alone.” Furthermore, he warned that, “as for anybody that violates this decree, a timber will be pulled out of his house and he will be impaled upon it, and his house will be turned into a public privy on this account.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 6:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Encouraged by so manifest a blessing from God, the Jews hastened the work and in less than four and one half years’ time the temple was completed. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a> gives <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>the date of completion, saying: “And they completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Adar, that is, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.” If the first year of Darius I is counted from 522 B.C.E., when his predecessor Cambyses died, then the rebuilding of the temple was completed in March of 516 B.C.E.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965723/0">a</a></p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">By this victory Cyrus brought to an end the domination of Mesopotamia and the Near East by Semitic rulers and produced the first dominant world power of Aryan origin. The Cyrus Cylinder, a cuneiform document historians consider to have been written for publication in Babylon, is strongly religious <span id="page410" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="410" data-before-text="410"></span>and in it Cyrus is represented as ascribing the credit for his victory to Marduk the chief god of Babylon, saying: “He [Marduk] scanned and looked (through) all the countries, searching for a righteous ruler willing to lead him (in the annual procession). (Then) he pronounced the name of Cyrus, king of Anshan, declared him (literally: pronounced [his] name) to be(come) the ruler of all the world. . . . Marduk, the great lord, a protector of his people/worshipers, beheld with pleasure his good deeds and his upright mind (and therefore) ordered him to march against his city Babylon. He made him set out on the road to Babylon going at his side like a real friend. His widespread troops—their number, like that of the water of a river, could not be established—strolled along, their weapons packed away. Without any battle, he made him enter his town Babylon, sparing Babylon any calamity.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 315.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Despite this pagan interpretation of events, the Bible shows that, on making his proclamation authorizing the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple there, Cyrus acknowledged: “All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me, and he himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1, 2</a>) This, of course, does not mean that Cyrus became a Jewish convert but simply that he knew the Biblical facts regarding his victory. In view of the high administrative position in which Daniel was placed, both before and after the fall of Babylon (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 5:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 6:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 28</a>), it would be most unusual if Cyrus were not to be informed of the prophecies that Jehovah’s prophets had recorded and spoken, including Isaiah’s prophecy containing Cyrus’ very name. As regards the Cyrus Cylinder, quoted above, it is acknowledged that others aside from the king may have had a hand in the preparation of this cuneiform document. The book <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> by G. Ernest Wright (p. 200) speaks of “the king, or the bureau which framed the document” (compare the similar case with Darius at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 6:6-9</a>), while Dr. Emil G. Kraeling (<em>Rand McNally Bible Atlas,</em> p. 328) calls the Cyrus Cylinder “a propaganda document composed by the Babylonian priests.” It may, indeed, have been drawn up under the influence of the Babylonian clergy (see Pritchard’s <em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 315, ftn. 1), thereby serving their purpose of explaining away the utter failure of Marduk (also known as Bel) and the other Babylonian gods to save the city, going even to the extent of attributing to Marduk the very things that Jehovah had done.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 47:11-15</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>CYRUS’ DECREE FOR THE RETURN OF THE JEWISH EXILES</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">By his decreeing the end of the Jewish exile, Cyrus fulfilled his commission as Jehovah’s ‘anointed shepherd’ for Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) The proclamation was made “in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia,” meaning his first year as ruler toward conquered Babylon.

This would mean that Cyrus’ first year may not have begun until late in the year 538 B.C.E. Even if Darius’ rule over Babylon were to be viewed as that of a viceroy, so that his reign ran concurrent with that of Cyrus, Babylonian custom would still place Cyrus’ first <em>regnal</em> year as running from Nisan of 538 to Nisan of 537 B.C.E.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could take about four months according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 7:9</a>) and yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by the “seventh month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E.

The inscription quotes him as saying: “I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B.

It was never intended for publication but solely for the eye of the proper official, following which it was filed away in governmental archives.”—<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 200.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>DEATH, SUCCESSOR, AND PROPHETIC SIGNIFICANCE</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Cyrus is believed to have fallen in battle about 530 B.C.E., though the accounts are somewhat obscure. Prior to his death, his son Cambyses evidently became coregent with him, succeeding to the Persian throne as sole ruler when his father died.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The prophecies concerning the sudden fall of symbolical “Babylon the Great” as set forth in the book of Revelation parallel in major respects the description of Cyrus’ conquest of the literal city of Babylon. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 16:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 18:7, 8</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:27, 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 47:8, 9</a>.)

The <em>Septuagint,</em> the Syriac <em>Peshitta Version</em> and the <em>Vulgate</em> here render “Eber” as “the Hebrews.” However, “Eber” may in this case mean “the land (or, people) on the other side,” thus referring to the land or people on the other side of the Euphrates (in addition to Assyria, mentioned in the same verse). The expression “the region on the other side of the river” (Heb., <em>ʽEʹver han-na·harʹ</em>) is used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011217/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:24</a> to refer to the “region west of the Euphrates” (<em>RS</em>), and the same phrase was used by the Assyrians and Persians to designate generally the region of Syria and Palestine.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011217/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 4:10, 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011217/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16, 17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011217/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011217/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 5:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011217/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011217/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 6:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011217/2/6" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">1.

The text, therefore, does not restrict Shem’s descendants to just the Hebrews, as the succeeding verses make clear.

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Religion and Law.</strong> The Persian rulers, while as capable of cruelty as the Semitic kings of Assyria and Babylonia, initially at least seem to have endeavored to manifest a degree of fairness and legality in their dealings with the conquered peoples. <span id="page613" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="613" data-before-text="613"></span>Their religion apparently contained some concept of ethics. Following their chief god Ahura Mazda, a principal deity was Mithra, who became known not only as a god of war but also as the god of contracts, the one whose eyes and ears were ever alert to spy out any violator of an agreement. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/4">GODS AND GODDESSES</a>.) Greek historian Herodotus (I, 136, 138) wrote of the Persians: “They educate their boys from five to twenty years old, and teach them three things only, riding and archery and truthtelling. . . . They hold lying to be foulest of all.” While the history of the Persian rulers shows them to be not above duplicity and intrigue, yet a basic adherence to some tribal creed of ‘keeping one’s word’ may be reflected in their insistence on the inviolability of “the law of the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Da 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Es 1:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 8:8</a>) Thus, when Cyrus’ decree was found some 18 years after its date of issuance, King Darius recognized the legality of the Jews’ position as regards the building of the temple and gave orders that full cooperation be extended to them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezr 6:1-12</a>.</p>

<strong>A Pivotal Date in History</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Jews, of course, left Babylon as quickly as possible after Cyrus’ decree, for, by reason of their knowledge of Jehovah’s prophecies by Jeremiah and Isaiah, they had prepared in advance for departure. But it would take some time to complete all preparations for 49,897 people, and it was a good four months’ journey back to the land of Judah. They arrived there just before the seventh month, Tishri.

No. Why not? The exiled Jews had to take advantage of the decree and leave Babylon and go back to their homeland and reoccupy it in order to end this desolation. For various reasons, such as old age, some Jews were not able to go back; but many others had become well established in highly materialistic Babylonia, and they preferred to remain in comfort rather than to exert themselves and suffer the hardships of traveling across a forbidding terrain to a land absolutely desolate. But the remnant of faithful Jews that returned were eager to obey Jehovah’s command. They were zealous for true worship at the place where he had put his name. They wanted to get away from unclean Babylon in order to be clean to bear Jehovah’s sacred vessels of worship back to the site of his holy temple.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 52:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jer. 50:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 51:6</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar as governor of the returning Jews and entrusted him with the delivering of the sacred utensils.

Well, it was in the seventh month of the year of Jerusalem’s destruction that the land of Judah was left completely desolate by the flight of the poor Jews who had not been deported by Nebuchadnezzar. In the seventh month they fled, taking the prophet Jeremiah with them down to Egypt.

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Cyrus’ cooperation with the Jews was in notable contrast with their treatment by earlier pagan rulers. He restored the precious temple utensils that Nebuchadnezzar II had carried off to Babylon, gave royal permission for them to import cedar timbers from Lebanon, and authorized the outlay of funds from the king’s house to cover construction expenses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezr 1:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 6:3-5</a>) According to the Cyrus Cylinder (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 332), the Persian ruler followed a generally humane and tolerant policy toward the conquered peoples of his domain. The inscription quotes him as saying: “I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.”​—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 316.</p>

<strong>Subjection to Superior Authorities</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> It appears from the context that the kings and others in high station refer to rulers of the worldly nations and others highly placed in public affairs. There are recorded instances in the Bible where Jehovah’s people offered prayers that concerned rulers, which prayers were sometimes on the behalf of such rulers. In Jeremiah’s day and after the Judean kings had <span id="page378" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="378" data-before-text="378"></span>been made tributary kings to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, there was political unrest in Judah, with many looking to Egypt for help in their seditions against Babylon. Even after many Jews were carried captive to Babylon, in 618 B.C., the seditious spirit flourished and hopes were high that Egypt would break the Babylonish yoke. Jeremiah prophesied differently, and rather than raising the hopes of Jews captive in Babylon for an early deliverance he told them to prepare for a long stay there, and added as a part of God’s message to them: “Seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jer. 29:1-7</a>) The purpose of the prayers to God for the captor city was that the captive Jews might lead “a calm and quiet life”.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">15. How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ezra 6:10</a> harmonize with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:1, 2</a>?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> After Babylon fell before the onslaught of Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian, the latter decreed that the Jews could return to Judah and rebuild the temple at Jerusalem. This was in 537 B.C., but it was only after years of interruption and opposition that the temple was completed, in 516 B.C. Opening the way for the Jewish governor Zerubbabel to complete the project was the intercession of Darius II, ruler of the Medo-Persian empire; and after ordering the opposers to help instead of hinder, and even commanding that supplies from the king’s goods be made available to the Jews for sacrifice at the temple, the Medo-Persian king added by way of explanation: “That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-10</a>) Apparently all of the wishes of Darius II were carried out, including the one that prayers be made by the Jews for him and his sons. There is no evidence otherwise.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">16. How are the backgrounds of these events in the days of Jeremiah and Zerubbabel and Paul similar?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> These two cases, the one in Jeremiah’s day and the other in Zerubbabel’s time, fit right in with the counsel Paul gave to Timothy. Both of them were in times when seditious movements or charges were prominent, and prayers for the entrenched rulers would show that the ones praying were not out to overthrow the government, but that they favored the continuance of the existing government rather than some new rebel regime run by men. They wanted peace, not revolution. Moreover, Nebuchadnezzar was used by God to punish backsliding Israel, and Darius II was a means for re-establishing true worship in Jerusalem. So it was when Paul wrote to Timothy about praying concerning highly stationed rulers, between A.D. 61-64. At that time seditions in Jerusalem and all Palestine were brewing, and soon thereafter precipitated the war with the Romans that led to the horrible destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The Christians did not participate in the Jewish seditions, did not have political prejudices and ambitions, but were interested only in peace and calm in which they could preach the gospel. They were out to overthrow no government, but would leave that to Christ Jesus in his due time. Until then, they could pray for peaceful administration of public affairs that would be conducive to “a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion”. Moreover, the Roman legions were instruments used to execute divine judgment against the Jews, just as Nebuchadnezzar had been so used centuries before, in 607 B.C.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 22:7</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">17. How might one pray on such occasions as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matthew 10:18</a> describes?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Not only could such prayers be pointed to by early Christians to prove they were innocent of the many charges of sedition brought against them, but also they could be used to possibly influence decisions <span id="page379" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="379" data-before-text="379"></span>rulers might make concerning gospel-preaching. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 23:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Acts 17:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 24:5</a>) Jesus warned his followers: “You will be haled before governors and kings for my sake for the purpose of a witness to them and the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 10:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) The Christian would certainly pray to God before such appearances, and the prayer would concern the official before whom you were to appear, he being mentioned. The Christian might pray that the message be presented clearly and boldly and in understandable form for the official or judge, and that if it please God will he make this highly stationed one amenable to the message, unprejudiced, reasonable, so that he will see the justice of the Christian’s cause and rule in his favor, allowing him freedom of action for preaching, and not curbing such activity by imprisoning the minister.</p>

<strong>Did Jesus Die on a Cross?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Was this “stake” a cross? No. In fact, the Hebrews had no word for the traditional cross. To designate such an implement, they used “warp and woof,” alluding to yarns running lengthwise in a fabric and others going across it on a loom. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a>, the Hebrew word translated “stake” is <em>‛ets,</em> meaning primarily a tree or wood, specifically a wooden post. Executional crosses were not used by the Hebrews. The Aramaic word <em>’a‘,</em> corresponding to the Hebrew term <em>‛ets,</em> appears at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 6:11</a>, where it is said regarding violators of a Persian king’s decree: “A <em>timber</em> will be pulled out of his house and he will be impaled upon it.” Obviously, a single <em>timber</em> would have no crossbeam.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In rendering <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a> (“stake”) and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezra 6:11</a> (“timber”), translators of the <em>Septuagint Version</em> employed the Greek word <em>xyʹlon,</em> the same term that Paul used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Galatians 3:13</a>. It was also the one employed by Peter, when he said Jesus “bore our sins in his own body upon the stake.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:24</a>) In fact, <em>xyʹlon</em> is used several other times to refer to the “stake” on which Jesus was impaled. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 5:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 10:39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974688/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 13:29</a>) This Greek word has the basic meaning of “wood.” There is nothing to imply that in the case of Jesus’ impalement it meant a stake with a crossbeam.</p>

<strong>Did Christ Die on a Cross?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span><strong>WHY NOT A TRADITIONAL CROSS</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Certainly in view of the foregoing it cannot honestly be stated that Christ without doubt was nailed on the traditionally shaped cross. And it is of striking interest to note that it is those authorities that lean toward the view that Christ was nailed on such a cross that admit doubt. But those who hold that Christ died on a simple stake or pole are not in doubt. Says one such: “Jesus died on a simple deathstake: In support of this there speak (a) the then customary usage of this means of execution in the Orient, (b) indirectly the history itself of Jesus’ sufferings and (c) many expressions of the early Church fathers.”—<em>The Cross and Crucifixion,</em> Hermann Fulda.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">That Christ did not die on the traditionally shaped cross is also indicated by the testimony of the catacombs. Thus Dean Burgon, in his <em>Letters from Rome,</em> wrote: “I question whether a cross occurs on any Christian monument of the first four centuries.” Mons Perret, who spent fourteen years doing research in the catacombs of Rome, counted in all a total of 11,000 inscriptions among the millions of tombs. According to him, “not until the latter years of the fourth century does the sign of the cross appear.” Among the signs that do appear are the dove, a symbol of the holy spirit; the lyre, a symbol of joy; the anchor, a symbol of hope and the fish. Why the fish? Because the letters of the word “fish” in Greek are the same as the first letters of “Jesus Christ, God’s Son, Savior.”<sup>4</sup></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">That Christ did not die on the traditionally shaped cross is also indicated by the Bible itself. It repeatedly tells of his dying on a tree, the Greek word being <em>xylon</em>.

(See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 26:47,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957201/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 55;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957201/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Mark 14:43,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957201/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957201/1/4" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> Luke 22:52</a>.) By saying that Christ died on a <em>xylon</em> these indicated that Christ died on a timber, a piece of wood.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Thus the apostle Paul states that Christ became a curse to those under the law by being fastened to a <em>xylon,</em> since “Accursed is every man hanged upon a stake [<em>xylon</em>].” Paul was there quoting from the law of Moses, which required that the bodies of executed criminals be fastened to a tree or stake as a warning and which meant that they were cursed by God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957201/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gal. 3:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957201/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Deut. 21:22, 23</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">A like example is found relative to one of the decrees of Cyrus, which warned that anyone refusing to obey, “a timber will be pulled out of his house and he will be impaled upon it.” In the Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em> the term for timber here is <em>xylon</em>. Again, not a cross but a simple straight beam.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957201/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 6:11</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Some argue that Christ died on a cross because early Christians used the letter “X” as a symbol for Christ. However, the “X” used in this manner does not at all refer to the tree on which Christ died. Rather, it stands for the name “Christ,” it being the first (Greek) letter of the name “Christ,” written “X” and pronounced “ch” or “K.” Thus “X” is an abbreviation, not a symbol.<sup>4</sup></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Nor does the fact that the Epistle of Barnabas and the Gospel of Nicodemus state that Jesus died on a cross prove anything. Both of these works are recognized by all authorities as forgeries. Obviously both were written after the cross had been adopted as a symbol of Christendom.<sup>4</sup></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>OF PAGAN ORIGIN</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Clearly there is no Scriptural support for the traditional cross as a symbol of <span id="page167" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>Christianity. Then how can its adoption by professed Christians be accounted for? It was borrowed from the surrounding pagans. It is another one of the many paganisms that the early apostate Christians adopted so as to appeal to the pagans and to be more like them. In this they followed the example of the Israelites who wanted a king so as to be like the nations round about. Thus Dr. Killen, in his <em>Ancient Church,</em> writes:</p>

What about this ancient silver coin?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many think of the Bible as an old book offering quaint stories and admirable morals. Yet, they do not believe that Bible accounts are accurate history, so they deny that it is the Word of God. There is, though, ample evidence of the Bible’s accuracy. This coin (enlarged view) is a good example. What does the writing say?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The coin was made in Tarsus, a city in the southeastern part of what is now Turkey. The coin was produced during the rule of the Persian governor Mazaeus in the fourth century B.C.E. It identifies him as governor of the province “Beyond the River,” that is, the Euphrates River.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But why is that phrase interesting? Because you will find the same designation in your Bible. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993449/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 5:6–6:13</a> sets out correspondence between the Persian king Darius and a governor named Tattenai. At issue was the Jews’ rebuilding of their temple in Jerusalem. Ezra was a skilled copyist of God’s Law, and you would expect him to be precise, accurate in what he wrote. You will see at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993449/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 5:6</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993449/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">6:13</a> that he termed Tattenai “the governor beyond the River.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Ezra penned that about 460 B.C.E., some 100 years before this coin was minted. Oh, some people might feel that the designation for an ancient official is a minor detail. But if you can rely on the Bible writers in even such small details, should that not increase your confidence in what else they wrote?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the first two articles in this issue, you will find additional reasons for such confidence.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="se"><strong>[Picture Credit Line on page 32]</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Collection of Israel Dept. of Antiquities Exhibited &amp; photographed Israel Museum</p>

Whereas most secular works fix the date of the start of his reign at 465 or 464 B.C.E., there is sound reason for placing it at an earlier date, as follows:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The first year of the reign of Xerxes, father and predecessor of Longimanus, ran from December of 486 B.C.E. to the spring of 485 B.C.E. During 480-479 B.C.E. (the seventh year of his reign) he attempted an invasion of Greece but suffered defeats due to the tactics of the Athenian general Themistocles. The book of Esther (which calls him Ahasuerus) refers to the twelfth year of Xerxes’ rule (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>) and indicates that his rule likely extended on into its thirteenth year (474 B.C.E.). Though modern historians generally extend Xerxes’ reign on to include a total of twenty-one years, and although some clay tablets referring to a sixteenth, twentieth and twenty-first year have been assigned by certain scholars to his reign, there is strong testimony to show that Xerxes’ rule ended in 474 B.C.E. and that he was then replaced by his son, Artaxerxes Longimanus.—See CHRONOLOGY.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The key to the matter relates to the flight of Athenian general Themistocles to the Persian capital, because of being accused of treason in his own land. The Greek historian Thucydides of Athens lived during the reign of Artaxerxes, and he records that Themistocles fled to Persia when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne.” (See Thucydides in Book I, chapter 137.) Nepos, a Roman historian of the first century B.C.E., supports this statement, saying: “I know that most historians have related that Themistocles went over into Asia in the reign of Xerxes, but I give credence to Thucydides in preference to others, because he, of all who have left records of that period, was nearest in point of time to Themistocles, and was of the same city. Thucydides says that he went to Artaxerxes.” (Nepos, <em>Themistocles,</em> chap. 9) Similarly, the Greek biographer Plutarch, of the first century C.E., says: “Thucydides, and Charon of Lampsacus, say that Xerxes was dead, and that Themistocles had an interview with his son, Artaxerxes; but Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, Heraclides and many others, write that he came to Xerxes. The chronological tables better agree with the account of Thucydides.”—Themistocles, c. 27; see also <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> 1956 ed., Vol. 26, p. 507.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The weight of historical evidence, therefore, points to Themistocles’ flight as occurring in the reign of Artaxerxes, not of Xerxes. As to the date of that flight, Jerome’s <em>Eusebius</em> places Themistocles’ arrival in Asia in the fourth year of the 76th Olympiad (four-year periods beginning in 776 B.C.E.), that is, in the year 473/472 B.C.E. Confirming this are the annals or chronology of Diodorus the Sicilian, a Greek historian of the first century B.C.E., which place the date of Themistocles’ death in 471 B.C.E. Since after his arrival Themistocles is reported to have requested one year’s time in which to learn Persian before receiving audience with the king, it fits well that his arrival would reasonably have taken place about two years before his death or by the year 473 B.C.E. And since, as Thucydides records, Themistocles arrived when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne,” then the first year of Artaxerxes’ reign evidently began in 474 B.C.E. The noted German scholar Ernst Wm. Hengstenberg (1802-1869) in his work entitled “Christology of the Old Testament” (Vol. 2, p. 395) states: “Krueger . . . places the death of Xerxes in the year 474 or 473, and the flight of Themistocles a year later.” Archbishop James Ussher, of Ireland (1581-1656), as a chronologist, also held that Artaxerxes Longimanus ascended the Persian throne in 474 B.C.E., as did the celebrated writer Vitringa (1659-1722).</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Accepting the year 474 B.C.E. on this basis as the initial year of Artaxerxes’ reign, we conclude that the twentieth year of his rule should have been the year 455 B.C.E., at which time his decree sent to Palestine by Nehemiah for the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem would go into effect, thus marking the start of the “seventy weeks” of Daniel’s prophecy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24</a>) Hengstenberg sums up the matter in saying (Vol. 2, p. 394): “The difference [of opinion] concerns only the year of the commencement of the reign of Artaxerxes. Our problem is completely solved, when we have shown that this year falls in the year 474 before Christ. For then the twentieth year of Artaxerxes is the year 455 before Christ, according to the usual reckoning.” Undoubtedly the strongest proof for the date of 455 B.C.E. as the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, however, is the fact of the Messiah’s appearance in the year 29 C.E., and his death in 33 C.E., in fulfillment of the time period indicated in Daniel’s prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 9:25, 26</a>; see MESSIAH.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:6</a> refers to the “thirty-second year of Artaxerxes,” at which time (443-442 B.C.E.) Nehemiah returned to Babylon for a time. Artaxerxes Longimanus evidently died in 424 or 423 B.C.E. (according to <em>Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.—A.D. 75</em> by Parker and Dubberstein, page 18) and was succeeded by Darius II.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

(<em>Babylonian Chronology, 626 B.C.</em>–<em>A.D. 75,</em> p. 30) Darius’ sixth year therefore began April 12, 516 B.C.E., and continued until the end of March of 515 B.C.E. On this basis, Zerubbabel’s rebuilding of Jehovah’s temple was completed on March 6 of 515 B.C.E.</p>

Since Darius’ inscriptions show him to be a devoted worshiper of Ahura Mazda, it is evident that his action, though serving Jehovah God’s purpose and doubtless having His direction, was basically taken out of respect for the irrevocable nature of the Medo-Persian laws and in harmony with a policy of tolerance by Darius’ government, evidence for which tolerance is found in some of his inscriptions.</p>

Well, Jehovah spoke of himself as “the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and all that I delight in he will completely carry out’; even in my saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ and of the temple, ‘You will have your foundation laid.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 44:27, 28</a>) King Cyrus did completely carry out the thing in which Jehovah delighted, though this was contrary to what the national god of Persia delighted to have done. In the year 537 B.C.E., the seventieth year of the desolation of Jerusalem and its temple, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus to decree that the temple should be rebuilt at Jerusalem. To that end Cyrus decreed that the exiles in Babylon who would volunteer for this temple work should be released from Babylon and go back to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) By the end of that seventieth year of Jerusalem’s desolation a faithful remnant of temple-work volunteers were back in the land of Judah, bringing to an end its desolation.

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To Jews who were looking for the coming of the Seed and who had faith in the Word of Jehovah God, it was certain that Jerusalem would not lie forever desolate but would again be rebuilt and would again flourish. They knew from Jeremiah’s prophecy that there was a seventy-year limit on Jerusalem’s desolation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 25:11, 12</a>) They knew of Jerusalem’s restoration and coming glory, from the prophecy of Isaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah, chapter 52</a>) They knew that when the Messiah came Jerusalem would have to be in existence, situated on Mount Zion, and that it must contain Jehovah’s temple of true worship. True, things looked bad at the time, for even the line of the royal family had been narrowed down very thin. All the sons of Zedekiah, Judah’s last king, were destroyed and only one of the reigning family, Jehoiachin or Jeconiah, Zedekiah’s nephew, survived. Similarly with the line of the high priest. Nebuchadnezzar put Seraiah to death but spared his son Jehozadak who, like Jeconiah, became captive in Babylon. But in this dark time the very survival of these two men and the fact that no foreign nation was allowed to settle in the land during Judah’s time of desolation served as strong signs to give bright hope to the faithful ones of the Jewish exiles. They could see that God was miraculously carrying out the preservation of the kingly and priestly lines and was also miraculously holding the land open until the time he would send his own people back to rebuild <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>Jerusalem. That the Messiah would come, not to a desolation, but to a rebuilt Jerusalem, was indicated in a remarkable prophecy at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a>: “And you should know and have the insight that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks. She will return and be actually rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in the straits of the times.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE BUILDING COMPLETED</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In our previous article we dealt with the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal line, accompanied by Jeshua the high priest, the son of Jehozadak. The return was by the decree of Cyrus the Persian, the conqueror of Babylon, as Jehovah had foretold. In 536 B.C.E. these returning Jews had the foundation of Jehovah’s temple laid. But shortly afterward the Devil set a roadblock in their way by causing the Samaritan enemies of the Jews to throw up an interference, eventually getting an official ban placed on the building work by the Persian government. This weakened the Jews so much that they left off this most important work and neglected the temple structure while they built homes for themselves. But even such opposition and the failure on the part of the Jewish remnant due to fear could not stop Jehovah’s purpose. He raised up the prophets Haggai and Zechariah who, with great zeal and a powerful message from God, stirred up the Jews to resume the temple building. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Zech. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Ezra 4:24-5:2</a>) It was during the second year of the reign of Darius I king of Persia, fifteen years after the foundation of the temple had been laid, that these prophets began to speak. Of course, the rebuilding work was quickly noticed by the enemy and the lawfulness of their activity was brought in question before the Persian-appointed officials governing the provinces between the Euphrates River and the Mediterranean Sea. But now the Jews, inspired by Haggai and Zechariah, were fearless and continued their work. They called attention to the fact that Cyrus had made the decree that the temple should be rebuilt. Thereupon, Tattenai the governor, to whom Zerubbabel was responsible, and other officials wrote to the king of Persia for his decision. Ezra the scribe reports the results:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“It was then that Darius the king put an order through, and they made an investigation in the house of the records of the treasures deposited there in Babylon. And at Ecbatana, in the fortified place that was in the jurisdictional district of Media, there was found a scroll [not a cuneiform tablet], and the memorandum to this effect was written within it: ‘In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king put an order through concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt as the place where they are to offer sacrifices, and its foundations are to be fixed, its height being sixty cubits, its width sixty cubits, with three layers of stones rolled into place and one layer of timbers; and let the expense be given from the king’s house. And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God that Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon be returned, that they may reach the temple that is in Jerusalem at its place and be deposited in the house of God.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Darius recognized the building work as lawful and strictly told the officials: “Keep your distance from there. Let the work on that house of God alone.” Furthermore, he warned that, “as for anybody that violates this decree, a timber will be pulled out of his house and he will be impaled upon it, and his house will be turned into a public privy on this account.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 6:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Encouraged by so manifest a blessing from God, the Jews hastened the work and in less than four and one half years’ time the temple was completed. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a> gives <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>the date of completion, saying: “And they completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Adar, that is, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.” If the first year of Darius I is counted from 522 B.C.E., when his predecessor Cambyses died, then the rebuilding of the temple was completed in March of 516 B.C.E.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965723/0">a</a></p>

In a little more than four years it was completed. “They completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Adar [February-March], that is, in the sixth <span id="page154" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="154" data-before-text="154"></span>year of the reign of Darius the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a>) That was in the year 516 B.C. With joy Jehovah’s worshipers inaugurated his completed sanctuary. The next month, Nisan 14, they held the Passover. Temple services went forward in this sanctuary constructed by Governor Zerubbabel, as they had gone forward in the temple built by Solomon. Once again the daily sacrifice, or the “constant [continual] burnt offering,” was rendered up to Jehovah mornings and evenings. In 468 B.C., which was the seventh year of the Persian King Artaxerxes, the Jewish priest named Ezra, who was also a copyist of the law of God, went up from Babylon at the order of the king to this temple at Jerusalem for the purpose of bringing a large contribution that was made to the support of Jehovah’s sanctuary. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1 to 8:36</a>) In the following century, according to report, there was a visit of another historical character to this sanctuary at Jerusalem. This was the visit of the Macedonian or Grecian king, Alexander the Great, in 332 B.C., as he was on his expedition of conquest over Persia,<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1959166/0">a</a> in fulfillment of prophecy.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">44.

The Syrian king, Antíochus IV Epíphanes, made a vicious attempt to stamp out the worship of Jehovah. In the year 168 B.C., he profaned Jehovah’s sanctuary by building an altar over the great altar of Jehovah and offering upon this an abominable sacrifice to the false god whom he worshiped, the Olympian Zeus (or Jupiter). This was on the 25th day of the Jewish month Chislev (November-December). He put a stop to the daily sacrifice or constant burnt offering at the temple. He ferociously persecuted the uncompromising worshipers of Jehovah. (1 Maccabees 1:20-64) This was what started the uprising of the Maccabees, the sons of the faithful priest Mattathias. Judas, the third son, being chosen leader, led his small forces to the defeat of the enemy, recaptured Jerusalem, and rededicated the temple on Chislev 25, 165 B.C., on the same day on which it had been desecrated by the Syrian king. Ever since then Jews have celebrated the feast of dedication, Hanukkah, on its anniversary. (1 Maccabees 4:36-59; 2 Maccabees 10:1-9; Josephus’ <em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book 12, Chapter 7, paragraph 7) This is referred to in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 10:22</a>: “At that time the feast of dedication took place in Jerusalem.

It was first in 37 B.C. that he stormed and took possession of Jerusalem and became king <em>de facto.</em> It is from this year that Herod’s kingship should be dated and counted. It is then found to overlap the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem about October 1, in 2 B.C. This wicked King Herod was the one that tried to murder the babe Jesus to prevent his growing up and becoming king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959166/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 2:1-19</a>.</p>

<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p263" data-pid="263" class="sb">Jerusalem came under final siege in Zedekiah’s ninth year (609 B.C.E.) and the city fell in his eleventh year (607), corresponding with Nebuchadnezzar’s nineteenth year of actual rule (counting from his accession year in 625). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/111/0" data-bid="112-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:1-8</a>) In the fifth month of that year (the month of Ab, corresponding to parts of July and August) the city was <span id="page348" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="348" data-before-text="348"></span>set afire, the walls were pulled down, and the majority of the people led off into exile. However, “some of the lowly people of the land” were allowed to remain and these did so until the assassination of Gedaliah, Nebuchadnezzar’s appointee, whereupon they fled into Egypt, finally leaving Judah completely desolate.

Hence the count of the seventy years of desolation must have begun about October 1, 607 B.C.E., ending in 537 B.C.E. It was in the seventh month of this latter year that the first repatriated Jews arrived back in Judah, exactly seventy years from the start of the full desolation of the land.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/113/0" data-bid="114-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/113/1" data-bid="114-2" class="b"> Ezra 3:1</a>.</p><p id="p264" data-pid="264" class="ss"><strong><em>From the Jewish return from exile to the conversion of Cornelius</em> (<em>537 B.C.E. to 36 C.E.</em>)</strong></p><p id="p265" data-pid="265" class="sb">In the second year of the return from exile (536 B.C.E.), the foundation of the temple was relaid in Jerusalem, but the rebuilt temple was not completed until the sixth year of the reign of Darius.

His first regnal year, then, began in the spring of 521 B.C.E. (<em>Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.—A.D. 75,</em> Parker and Dubberstein, page 30) Darius’ sixth year therefore began April 11/12, 516 B.C.E., and continued until the end of March of 515 B.C.E. On this basis, the rebuilding of the temple was completed by Zerubbabel on March 5/6 of 515 B.C.E.</p><p id="p266" data-pid="266" class="sb">The next date of major importance is the commissioning of Nehemiah in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes I.

This commissioning, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its walls resulting from it, form the starting point of the prophecy concerning the “seventy weeks” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/116/0" data-bid="117-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a>.

As demonstrated under the heading SEVENTY WEEKS, the prophecy pointed to Jesus’ appearance as the Messiah in the year 29 C.E.; his death at the “half of the week” or in the middle of the last week of years, that is, in 33 CE.; and the end of the period of God’s special favor to the Jews in 36 C.E. Thus, the seventy weeks of years closed with the conversion of Cornelius, 490 years from the year 455 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/118/0" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Acts 10:30-33,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/118/1" data-bid="119-2" class="b"> 44-48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/118/2" data-bid="119-3" class="b"> 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p267" data-pid="267" class="sb">Jesus’ appearance as the Messiah came in the precise year foretold, six months after John the Baptist began his preaching in the “fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/119/0" data-bid="120-1" class="b">Luke 1:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/119/1" data-bid="120-2" class="b"> 3:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/119/2" data-bid="120-3" class="b"> 21-23</a>) Since, as has been shown, Tiberius began his rule on August 17, 14 C.E. (Gregorian calendar), his fifteenth year ran from August 17, 28 C.E., to August 16, 29 C.E. The evidence, then, is that Jesus’ baptism and anointing took place in the fall of the year 29 CE.</p><p id="p268" data-pid="268" class="sb">Since Jesus was thirty years of age in 29 C.E. at the time of his baptism (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/120/0" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Luke 3:23</a>), his birth took place thirty years earlier, or about the fall of the year 2 B.C.E. He was born during the reign of Caesar Augustus and the Syrian governorship of Quirinius. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/121/0" data-bid="122-1" class="b">Luke 2:1, 2</a>) Augustus’ rule ran from 27 B.C.E. to 14 C.E. P. Sulpicius Quirinius, Roman senator, was governor of Syria twice, the first time evidently coming after P. Quintilius Varus, whose term as legate of Syria ended in 4 B.C.E. Some authorities place Quirinius’ first governorship in 3-2 B.C.E. (See REGISTRATION.) Herod the Great was then king of Judea, and we have seen that there is evidence pointing to the year 1 B.C.E. as the likely time of his death. Thus, all the available evidence, and particularly the Scriptural references, indicate the fall of 2 B.C.E. for the human birth of God’s Son.</p><p id="p269" data-pid="269" class="ss"><strong><em>The later apostolic period</em> (<em>36 to c. 100 C.E.</em>)</strong></p><p id="p270" data-pid="270" class="sb">It is possible to fix approximate dates for a number of the events taking place during this period. The prophecy of a great famine spoken by the Christian prophet Agabus, and the subsequent persecution instigated by Herod Agrippa I, resulting in the apostle James’ death and the jailing of Peter, evidently took place in 44 C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/122/0" data-bid="123-1" class="b">Acts 11:27-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/122/1" data-bid="123-2" class="b"> 12:1-4</a>) Herod Agrippa died that year and there is evidence that the foretold famine came in the year 46 C.E. This latter date (or shortly thereafter) probably marks the time of the relief ministration effected by Paul and Barnabas.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/123/0" data-bid="124-1" class="b">Acts 12:25</a>.</p><p id="p271" data-pid="271" class="sb">Paul’s first visit to Corinth can be dated through the proconsulship of Gallio. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/124/0" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Acts 18:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/124/1" data-bid="125-2" class="b"> 11-18</a>) As explained in the article on GALLIO, this proconsulship ran from the summer of 51 to the summer of 52 C.E. Thus, Paul’s eighteen-month activity in Corinth likely began in the autumn of 50 C.E., ending in the spring of 52 C.E. This is further confirmed by the fact that two of Paul’s associates in Corinth, Aquila and Priscilla, had recently arrived there from Italy due to Emperor Claudius’ edict requiring all Jews to depart from Rome. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/125/0" data-bid="126-1" class="b">Acts 18:2</a>) Paulus Orosius, historian of the fifth century, states that this order was given in Claudius’ ninth year, early in 50 C.E.</p><p id="p272" data-pid="272" class="sb">The two years Paul spent in prison at Caesarea were during the last two years of the governorship of Felix, Paul thereafter being sent on to Rome by Felix’ successor Porcius Festus.

However, the most probable time appears to narrow down to the years from 57 to 60 C.E., with some modern authorities favoring either 59 or 60 C.E. At any rate, Paul’s subsequent arrival in Rome may be placed between 59 and 61 C.E.</p><p id="p273" data-pid="273" class="sb">The great fire that ravaged Rome came in July of 64 C.E. and was followed by fierce persecution of Christians, Nero being the instigator. It is probable that Paul’s second imprisonment and his execution took place shortly thereafter.

The traditional view is that John was released from exile following Domitian’s death and died in Ephesus about the close of the first century C.E. Thus, by John’s writing his epistles about this time, the Bible canon was completed and the apostolic period came to its close.</p>

<strong>Darius</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Following the death of Cambyses II, who died about 522 B.C.E. while returning from Egypt, the Persian throne was occupied for a short time by Gaumata (or Bardiya). Darius, with the aid of six other Persian nobles, slew Gaumata and gained the throne, the account of this being set forth in three languages in the immense Behistun Inscription that Darius had carved on sheer cliffs facing a plain through which ran the principal caravan route from Baghdad to Teheran. According to the inscription Gaumata was a usurper, posing as Cambyses’ brother who had been put to death. Most modern authorities accept this account (which is laced with repeated assurances by Darius that “it is true and not lies”) as basically factual, while some believe that Darius was a “monumental liar” and that the evidence indicates him to be the actual usurper. Whatever the case, Darius was faced with an empire in revolt upon assuming the kingship and is considered as having spent the next two years in subduing the insurrectionary elements throughout the realm. Egypt, which had thrown off the Persian yoke, was reconquered by Darius about 519-518 B.C.E. Thereafter he extended the imperial borders into India in the E and into Thrace and Macedonia in the W. He is noted as well for his <span id="page422" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="422" data-before-text="422"></span>efficient reorganization of the administrative structure throughout the empire, the formation of an imperial law code, called the “Ordinance of Good Regulations,” and for having reopened the canal connecting the Nile River of Egypt with the Red Sea.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">It is particularly with regard to the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem that Darius Hystaspis figures in the Bible record. The temple work had begun in 537 B.C.E. but about 522 it came under ban and “continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius” (520/519). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezra 4:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 24</a>) During this year the prophets Haggai and Zechariah stirred up the Jews to renew the construction and the work got under way again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezra 5:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Zech. 1:1</a>) This provoked an inquiry and the sending of a letter to Persian King Darius by Tattenai, the governor representing the imperial interests in the region W of the Euphrates, and other officials, advising him of the construction work, setting forth the Jews’ claim for the legality of the project, and requesting an investigation in the royal archives to see if there existed written evidence to substantiate that claim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezra 5:3-17</a>) The Jewish declaration that contrasted the actions of the Chaldean Nebuchadnezzar, as the destroyer of the temple, with the Persian Cyrus, as the one authorizing its reconstruction, should have had an appropriate and felicitous effect on Darius since, in the first years of his reign, he had to overcome two revolts by rebels each taking the name Nebuchadnezzar (called Nebuchadnezzar III and Nebuchadnezzar IV by historians), claiming to be sons of Nabonidus, and endeavoring to make Babylon independent of the Persian Empire.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The official search of records in the archives at Ecbatana, the ancient Median capital, uncovered the document by Cyrus. Darius thereupon sent orders to Governor Tattenai that he and the other officials should not only refrain from interfering with the temple work but also provide building funds from the “royal treasury of the tax beyond the River,” as well as animals and other necessary supplies for the sacrificial offerings. Anyone violating the king’s order was to be impaled on a stake and his house “turned into a public privy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-12</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">With this official cooperation, and with continued prophetical encouragement (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Zech. 7:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 8:1-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 20-23</a>), the temple work went on to successful completion by the “sixth year of the reign of Darius” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ezra 6:13-15</a>; probably by March 5/6 of 515 B.C.E.). Since Darius’ inscriptions show him to be a devoted worshiper of Ahura Mazda, it is evident that his action, though serving Jehovah God’s purpose and doubtless having his direction, was basically done out of respect for the irrevocable nature of the Medo-Persian laws and in harmony with a policy of tolerance by Darius’ government, evidence for which tolerance is found in some of his inscriptions.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong>LATER CAMPAIGNS IN GREECE</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Toward the turn of the century, various Greek cities of Ionia revolted against Persian domination and, though their revolt was quelled, Darius determined to punish Athens and Eretria for their having rendered aid to the rebellious cities. This led to a Persian invasion of Greece, resulting, however, in defeat of Darius’ forces at the battle of Marathon in 490 B.C.E. Though Darius made careful preparations for a further Grecian campaign, he was unable to carry it out before his death in 486 B.C.E. He was succeeded by his son Xerxes.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">3. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Nehemiah 12:22</a> mentions the recording of Levitical heads of paternal houses “in the days of Eliashib, Joiada and Johanan and Jaddua . . . down till the kingship of Darius the Persian.” Since Eliashib was high priest at the time of Nehemiah’s return to Jerusalem (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1</a>) and since by the time of Nehemiah’s second visit to that city (during or following the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes [c. 443 B.C.E.]) Joiada had a married son (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Neh. 13:28</a>), it is likely that the “Darius” mentioned was Darius II, Ochus (also called Nothus, the “illegitimate son” of Artaxerxes I), who ruled from 423 to 404 B.C.E.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">A letter found among the Elephantine Papyri, reckoned as dating from the last years of the fifth century B.C.E., makes reference to “Johanan” as high priest at Jerusalem at that time.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">4. Darius III (surnamed Codomannus), the last king of the Persian Empire. He became king in 336 B.C.E., the same year Alexander the Great was crowned king of Macedonia. Though Darius III is not mentioned directly in the Bible account, he, as the head of the Persian Empire, experienced the fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy concerning the two-horned ram (representing Medo-Persia) and the powerful he-goat (representing the Grecian kingdom). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Dan. 8:2-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>) Darius III was able to effect the reconquest of Egypt, but when he later (334 B.C.E.) marched against the swiftly advancing forces of Alexander he met defeat at the Granicus River in the northwestern corner of Asia Minor. The Persian forces withdrew and prepared for another attempt at halting Alexander’s advances, this time engaging the Greek forces on the narrow plain of Issus, at the point where Asia Minor and Syria join. Again Alexander routed the Persians and, two years later (331), the final battle was fought at Gaugamela, not far from the ruins of ancient Nineveh on the Tigris River. Utterly defeated, Darius took flight but was murdered by a satrap of the Persian Empire in the year 330 B.C.E. Thus, the Medo-Persian Empire had “no deliverer out of its [the symbolic he-goat’s] hand.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Dan. 8:7</a>; see PERSIA, PERSIANS.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Encouraged by so manifest a blessing from God, the Jews hastened the work and in less than four and one half years’ time the temple was completed. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a> gives <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>the date of completion, saying: “And they completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Adar, that is, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.” If the first year of Darius I is counted from 522 B.C.E., when his predecessor Cambyses died, then the rebuilding of the temple was completed in March of 516 B.C.E.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965723/0">a</a></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The next month after Adar is Nisan. So by completing the temple on Adar 3 the Jews were able to inaugurate it in time to hold the Passover in Nisan in the beginning of the seventh year of King Darius I: “And the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the former exiles held the inauguration of this house of God with joy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezra 6:16</a>) Now worship of Jehovah at Jerusalem was fully restored.

And what about Isaiah’s prophecy that Jerusalem would flourish and Daniel’s prophecy about the rebuilding of its public square and moat? While it was some time before this took place, still it was something that had to be done to prepare the way for the coming of Messiah the Prince. It was not until the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia that Jehovah stirred up the spirit of another faithful servant to see that this was done. This servant was Nehemiah, who at the time had the responsible position of cupbearer to King Artaxerxes of Persia. Though he could not be in Jerusalem, nevertheless his heart was there, for there, he knew, was centered the true worship of Jehovah. Jerusalem was the place on which Jehovah’s name rested and it was the temple of Jehovah that was now rebuilt there. He tells us of his concern over the city and the delay in rebuilding revealed by a report of its condition some sixty years after the temple had been rebuilt: “Now it came about in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, that I myself happened to be in Shushan the castle. Then Hanani, one of my brothers, came in, he and other men from Judah, and I proceeded to ask about the Jews, those who had escaped, who had been left over of the captivity, and also about Jerusalem. Accordingly they said to me: ‘Those left over, who have been left over from the captivity, there in the jurisdictional district, are in a very bad plight and in reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its very gates have been burned with fire.’ . . . Now I myself happened to be cupbearer to the king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Nehemiah was greatly grieved on hearing this report. He took the matter immediately to Jehovah in prayer. The answer to his prayer was not long in coming. He tells us: “And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I as usual took up the wine and gave it to the king. But never had I happened to be gloomy before him. So the king said to me: ‘Why is your face gloomy when you yourself are not sick? This is nothing but a gloominess of heart.’ At this I became very much afraid.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Nehemiah explained the reason for his sadness to the king. When Artaxerxes asked: “What is this that you are seeking to secure?” Nehemiah offered a silent prayer to Jehovah and took courage to ask the king to send him to rebuild Jerusalem. <span id="page601" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="601" data-before-text="601"></span>The prayer was answered; King Artaxerxes was agreeable. Nehemiah relates: “So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time. And I went on to say to the king: ‘If to the king it does seem good, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River [Euphrates], that they may let me pass until I come to Judah; also a letter to Asaph the keeper of the park that belongs to the king, that he may give me trees to build with timber the gates of the Castle that belongs to the house, and for the wall of the city and for the house into which I am to enter.’ So the king gave them to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Neh. 2:3-8</a>.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204404/203/0">8/15/1956, pp. 486-488</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Were the Ten Tribes Lost?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Secondly, the Scriptures leave no doubt that both Israel and Judah were involved <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>in the return from Babylonian captivity. Perhaps not many of the ten-tribe kingdom returned, but not many of the two-tribe kingdom did either, that is, comparatively speaking. Thus we read: “For though thy people, Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them shall return.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 10:22</a>, <em>AS</em>) It would seem therefore that the some 55,000 that returned to Palestine were only a small part of the number of Israelites living in Babylon at the time Cyrus issued his liberation decree.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">That the return from Babylon was understood to be a representative return of all the twelve tribes is apparent from a number of facts. For example, we find far more references to Israel than to Judah in the postexilic books of Ezra and Nehemiah. We should not find any references to Israel if the Anglo-Israelite theory were correct. Then again, we repeatedly find the expression “all Israel” applied to the returned exiles, in just the same style that Nehemiah speaks of King Solomon’s being made king over “all Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 2:70;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Neh. 13:26</a>) And that the returned exiles considered themselves as one, as representatives of all the twelve tribes, is further seen by their presentation at the temple’s inauguration “as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 6:17</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">This uniting of the two kingdoms was foretold in prophecies that had a miniature fulfillment at that time: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand. . . . I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.” Then also the prophecy was true that “Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Isa. 11:13</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">And thirdly, the fallacy of the Anglo-Israelite theory is further demonstrated by the Christian Greek Scriptures, in which the Jews are referred to as Israel some seventy-five times. Jesus repeatedly stated that he was sent to the “lost sheep of the house of Israel,” not just to the lost sheep of the house of Judah, but to all twelve tribes. There is also record of a prophetess Anna, “of Asher’s tribe,” serving at the temple. And when Jesus was impaled on the torture stake we find the terms “King of the Jews” and “King of Israel” used interchangeably.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 10:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 2:36</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 27:37,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 42</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Consider: if only those of the two tribes had returned to Palestine, why would Peter on the day of Pentecost say: “Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God” made this Jesus Lord and Christ? And if ten of the twelve tribes had gone to the British Isles and were lost, why would James, under inspiration, address his letter to the twelve tribes? Note also Paul’s words: “Our twelve tribes are hoping to attain to the fulfillment of this [resurrection] promise by intensely rendering him sacred service night and day.” How could Paul make such a statement if ten of the twelve tribes were lost and no longer trying to serve God?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 2:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 26:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Jas. 1:1</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>PROMISES TO SPIRITUAL ISRAEL</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">An Anglo-Israelite writes: “Every Briton is born to a great inheritance, and therefore a great responsibility.” But God’s Word shows that ties of flesh are no grounds for boasting: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman” in the Christian congregation.

In the Hebrew manuscripts, the title is the opening word, <em>Bereʼ·shithʹ,</em> “in the beginning” (Greek, <em>en ar·kheiʹ</em>). Genesis is the first book of the Pentateuch (an Anglicized Greek word meaning “five rolls” or “fivefold volume”). Evidently this was originally one book called the Torah (Law) or “the book of the law of Moses” but was later divided into the five rolls for easier handling.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990062/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 23:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990062/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ezra 6:18</a>.</p>

<strong>Overseers of Life</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> The nation was to be “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” preparatory to the coming of the Messiah. After receiving the laws and commandments from Jehovah, “Moses came and called the older men of the people and set before them all these words that Jehovah had commanded him. After that all the people answered unanimously <span id="page268" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="268" data-before-text="268"></span>and said: ‘All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex. 19:6-8</a>) Faithfulness to this covenant would always bring them prosperity from Jehovah, but disobedience would bring their rejection. “For Jehovah your God is walking about within your camp to deliver you and to abandon your enemies to you; and your camp must prove to be holy, that he may see nothing indecent in you and certainly turn away from accompanying you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deut. 23:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

The history of the Jewish nation is one turbulent period after another, marked with disobedience, rebellion, complaint, apostasy and corruptness. On arriving in the Promised Land, they were not content with Jehovah as King and with the judges and priests who were administering the affairs of the nation. They asked for a king, only to be enslaved by him. Among other detestable things, Saul, the first king, presumptuously began to offer sacrifice to Jehovah without waiting for the prophet Samuel to arrive before the troops moved into battle. The kingship was wrested from him and given to David, a man after Jehovah’s own heart. Jehovah used David and his reign to picture the rulership of his heavenly King, Christ Jesus. David did not launch a coup d’etat to unseat Saul prematurely, but waited until Jehovah saw fit to remove this unfaithful one—a good example for us today.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">14.

True to his promise, Jehovah caused a deliverance, and instructions went forth to rebuild the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem. Temple work was organized under Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua. Jehovah blessed the efforts of these faithful overseers who inspected, directed and corrected matters in connection with this vast project. On their completing the temple work an inauguration of it was held. “And they appointed the priests in their classes and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God which is in Jerusalem, according to the prescription of the book of Moses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ezra 6:18</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">15.

Contrary to some other overseers in the past, he did not oppress the people or demand special favors. “As for me, I did not do that way on account of the fear of God. And, what is more, in the work of this wall I took a hand, and not a field did we acquire; and all my attendants were collected together there for the work.” With a clear conscience he could pray: “Do remember for me, O my God, for good, all that I have done in behalf of this people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 5:15, 16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p>

Wiseman, p. 61) Thus the fierce Assyrian rule came to an ignominious end, though Ashur-uballit is referred to as attempting, briefly and unsuccessfully, to continue Assyrian rule from Haran as his capital city.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Isa. 10:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 24-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 23:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 30:30-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/41/4" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 31:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/41/5" data-bid="42-6" class="b"> Nah. 3:1-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/41/6" data-bid="42-7" class="b"> Zeph. 2:13</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The Babylonian Chronicles (B.M. 21901) indicate an alliance of Assyrian troops and Egyptian troops against Babylon at this point, and this factor is in harmony with the account relative to the activity of Pharaoh Nechoh recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:29</a> (see footnote of <em>NW,</em> 1955 ed.), resulting in the death of King Josiah of Judah (629/628 B.C.E.). This text states that “Pharaoh Nechoh the king of Egypt came up against the king of Assyria by the river Euphrates,” but the “king of Assyria” against whom Nechoh came is doubtless the Babylonian conqueror of Assyria, Nabopolassar, who, by virtue of his conquest, could now properly be styled the true “king of Assyria.” (See NECHO.) A few years later (625 B.C.E.), Nechoh was thoroughly defeated by the Babylonians in the battle of Carchemish.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Jer. 46:2</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">The title “king of Assyria” was similarly applied to the Persian king (Darius I [Hystaspis]) who dominated Assyria in the time of the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem (completed in 515 B.C.E.).—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ezra 6:22</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="ss"><strong>ASSYRIA IN PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">Assyria figured in the prophecy uttered by Balaam about the year 1473 B.C.E.

Frequent condemnation was made of the reliance placed upon such pagan nations by apostate Israel and Judah, often vacillating between Egypt and Assyria, like “a simple-minded dove without heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Jer. 2:18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/46/1" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/46/2" data-bid="47-3" class="b"> Lam. 5:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/46/3" data-bid="47-4" class="b"> Ezek. 16:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/46/4" data-bid="47-5" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/46/5" data-bid="47-6" class="b"> 23:5-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/46/6" data-bid="47-7" class="b"> Hos. 7:11</a>) The disastrous results of such course are vividly described.
