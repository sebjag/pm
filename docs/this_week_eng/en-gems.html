<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It has long been held by some that Hebrew music was all melody, without harmony. However, the prominence alone of the harp and other stringed instruments in Israel weighs heavily against this assumption. It is almost inconceivable that a musician would play a multistringed instrument and fail to notice that a combination of certain tones was quite pleasing or that a specific series of notes as in an arpeggio produced a pleasant sound. An authority on the history of music, Kurt Sachs, states: “The deep-rooted prejudice that harmony and polyphony [two or more musical parts or voices combined] have been a <span id="page1193" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1193" data-before-text="1193"></span>prerogative of the medieval and modern West does not hold water.” He goes on to say that even among primitive cultures there are many examples of music running in fifths, fourths, thirds as well as in octaves, and that among these peoples, including certain pygmy tribes, there was a development of overlapping antiphony (alternate singing by two divisions of vocalists) into regular canon singing.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Based on worldwide research Sachs presents the conclusion that “the choruses and orchestras connected with the Temple in Jerusalem suggest a high standard of musical education, skill, and knowledge.” He continues: “It is important to realize that the ancient Western Orient had a music quite different from what historians of the nineteenth century conceded it. . . . Though we do not know how that ancient music sounded, we have sufficient evidence of its power, dignity, and mastership.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The Scriptures intimate a similar conclusion. For instance, over thirty times the expression “To [For] the director” (<em>NW; AT</em>) appears in the superscriptions to the Psalms. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 11</a>, and others) Other translations read “choirmaster” (<em>Kx; JB; Mo; RS</em>); “Chief Musician” (<em>AS; AV; Le; Ro</em>) and “Bandmaster” (<em>Fn</em>). The Hebrew term seems to refer to one who in some way gave direction to the execution of the song, either in arranging it, or in rehearsing and training the Levite singers or in its official performance. Perhaps the chief one of each of the twenty-four courses of sanctuary musicians is being addressed, or it may have been another one of the accomplished musicians, since the record says that they were “to act as directors.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Chron. 15:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 25:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 7-31</a>) In some twenty other Psalms the superscriptions are even more specific in their reference to the “directors”: “To the director on stringed instruments,” “To the director on the lower octave,” and so on.

In the Scriptures this apparently is referred to as “responding.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ex. 15:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 18:6, 7</a>) This type of singing is indicated by the very way some of the psalms are written, such as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Psalm 136</a>. The description of the two large thanksgiving choirs in Nehemiah’s time and of their part in the inauguration of the wall of Jerusalem implies that they sang in this style.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 38,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 40-42</a>; see SONG.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Chanting might be said to be halfway between singing and speaking. In pitch it is rather monotonous and repetitious, with the emphasis being on rhythm. While chanting continues to be quite popular in some of the world’s leading religions, its use in the Bible appears to be limited to dirges, as in the case of David chanting a dirge over the deaths of his friend Jonathan and King Saul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Sam. 1:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 35:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Ezek. 27:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/42/3" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> 32:16</a>) Only in a dirge or lamentation would the chanting style be preferable to either the melody of music or the modulation and oral emphasis of pure speech.—See DIRGE.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Jehovah, a Dependable Refuge</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHAT can you do when there is a serious breakdown of law and order, when there seems to be no possibility of getting justice? Where can you turn? The psalmist David once faced such a situation. He placed his complete trust in the Most High, saying: “In Jehovah I have taken refuge.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979129/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 11:1</a>) But was this practical?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Others did not think so. They advised David and his associates to flee to the mountains, perhaps taking refuge in a cave, doing so quickly as does a bird when in danger. But the psalmist would not hear of it, evidently because the circumstances at the time were such that flight would have indicated a lack of faith in Jehovah as a provider of security. To his advisers he said: “How dare you men say to my soul [to me]: ‘Flee as a bird to your [plural, manifestly referring to David and his associates] mountain!’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979129/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 11:1</a>.</p>

<strong>On What Foundation Are You Building?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The prophet Isaiah, for example, refers to Jehovah God as the one “laying the foundation of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005369/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:13</a>) This foundation consists of the unchangeable laws of God that control the movement of the earth and hold it in its place. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005369/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 104:5</a>) God’s Word, the Bible, also speaks of “the foundations” on which human society rests. These are justice, law, and order. When they are “torn down,” or undermined, by injustice, corruption, and violence, there is a breakdown in social order.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005369/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 11:2-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005369/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Proverbs 29:4</a>.</p>

They offer an honest opinion when you invite them to do so. When you need help, they provide it generously. When you need counsel, they offer it in love. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008760/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 141:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008760/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:1</a>) Are you not drawn to such people? Well, Jehovah and his Son are just like that. In fact, their interest in you exceeds that of any human, and their motive is entirely unselfish; they want to help you to “get a firm hold on the real life.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008760/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008760/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Rev. 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 2.

David also wrote: “You have examined my heart, you have made inspection by night . . . You will discover that I have not schemed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008760/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 17:3</a>) Clearly, David was aware of the depth of Jehovah’s interest in him. He knew that he would hurt Jehovah and merit His displeasure if he nurtured sinful thoughts or developed a scheming heart.

For example, when Sarah, the wife of Abraham, spoke less than truthfully to a materialized angel, the angel evidently saw that she was afraid and embarrassed, so he simply gave her a mild reproof.

Consider his dealings with Abimelech, king of the Philistine city of Gerar. Abimelech, not realizing that Abraham and Sarah were married, took Sarah to become his own wife. However, before Abimelech could go any further, Jehovah said to him in a dream: “I too have known that in the honesty of your heart you have done this, and I was also holding you back from sinning against me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her. But now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will make supplication for you.

<strong>Jehovah, a Dependable Refuge</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What was David’s answer? “Jehovah is in his holy temple. Jehovah​—in the heavens is his throne.

He will rain down upon the wicked ones traps, fire and sulphur and a scorching wind, as the portion of their cup.

He realized that the Most High, the One who has his throne in the highest heavens, is watching. Jehovah’s eyes penetrate to the very heart of things. Nothing escapes his notice. Since Jehovah’s eyes are on the righteous, he knows what they need and, therefore, can come to their rescue. On the other hand, the Most High hates men of violence and, hence, his examining them makes their calamity certain. The time is bound to come when the wicked will be forced to drink the death-dealing potion of Jehovah’s judgments, comparable to traps, fire, sulphur and a scorching wind that withers vegetation. There will be no escaping from the execution of God’s judgments. It will be as if traps or snares are falling like rain from the sky above. Because Jehovah is himself righteous and loves righteous acts, the upright will experience a grand salvation. It will prove to be as if God’s face is turned toward them in an expression of love and approval. Thus they will see God’s face as persons enjoying his blessing and favor.</p>

<strong>The One True Temple at Which to Worship</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Certainly, when Jehovah God created Adam and Eve in human perfection in the garden of Eden, there was no need of such a temple in heaven. Why not? Because at that time after the creation of the perfect man and woman at the close of the sixth creative day, when “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good,” there was no sin in all creation, either in heaven or on earth. There was no need for God to have a high priest to offer up sin-atoning sacrifices, nor was there need for an altar in a temple courtyard on which to offer up a sin offering.

<strong>Proper Viewpoint of Discipline</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Reinstatement is not just a matter of waiting for a specified time to elapse and then making the proper request in writing to the congregation. No; during the period of excommunication the wrongdoer’s heart condition, his basic attitude, must undergo a profound change. The sinner must fully <span id="page473" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="473" data-before-text="473"></span>realize the gravity of his wicked course and the great reproach he has brought upon Jehovah and his organization. He must feel cut to the heart. But he must do more. He must go farther than mere recognition of a wrong and feeling sorry. He must repent, which means to feel such sorrow for sin or fault as to be disposed to change one’s life for the better. There has to be a converting or changing of his entire course of action. Yes, he must “set matters straight” in harmony with God’s righteous requirements. Then he can approach the congregation committee, acknowledge his wrong, and give evidence he is living a clean life and will continue to do so. In this way he will prove that he is worthy of receiving Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and be reinstated.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If these necessary evidences of sorrow and change are present, then his reinstatement could be considered by the congregation committee after sufficient time had elapsed, which in most cases is at least a year.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>WHY CONFESS?</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">When the Christian considers the Scriptural aspects of disfellowshiping it should make him keenly aware of the displeasure God expresses toward persistent wrongdoing. It should make him realize just how serious a thing it is to practice sin. It should make him reaffirm his determination never to pursue a course of wrongdoing. How disastrous it is to be disfellowshiped! What great reproach is brought upon God, upon God’s congregation, upon the individual concerned and upon his family members!</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">With such grave consequences involved, a few who have fallen into sin might be tempted to reason this way: ‘Well, I know I have done wrong, but I also know that if I tell anyone about it I might be disfellowshiped. I’ve learned how terrible this can be, and I don’t want to go through that. I had better not tell anyone about this. Nobody will ever know, and all that shame will be avoided.’</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Such reasoning ignores many things. One is God’s quality of mercy. Another is the benefit that comes from being disciplined by Jehovah. The heart attitude of such a person is wrong. His reasoning is fallacious and dangerous to himself. In the first place he does not appreciate that this will begin to sear his conscience and open the way for more wrongdoing. Since he “got away” with it once, it will be easier to do again. The fallacy is that his sin is not against just another person, or against just God’s congregation. His sin is against Jehovah! While it might be possible to hide a course of wickedness from other people for a while, it is not possible to hide it from Jehovah!</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jehovah observes what men do. “Jehovah is in his holy temple. Jehovah—in the heavens is his throne. His own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men.

The person who falls into sin, but who wants to do what is right, should go to the overseer of the congregation and make an honest confession of his transgression.

All his creation he faithfully oversees to ensure that his will is accomplished and that those having the right to life walk in the proper way to retain it. He is a God of purpose and a God of order. To maintain good organization, the spirit creatures and the animate and inanimate bodies were all set in their respective positions, and moral as well as physical laws were established to keep every creation in harmony with him. Although uncountable miles from some of his creation, he is still able to give close oversight. Commenting upon the far-reaching purview of Jehovah, the psalmist David exclaimed: “Jehovah is in his holy temple. Jehovah—in the heavens is his throne.

The visit or inspection might be a friendly one or a hostile one, depending upon the condition found and what was needed to correct it. To fulfill his responsibilities properly, an overseer would have to know what to look for, where to look and how to administer the principles of the Supreme One when faced with a given situation. Within his hand there would be as a trust the power to bestow blessing and commendation as well as punishment and correction; but he, too, would be responsible to Jehovah as to how he fulfilled this trust.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 3.

This was no insignificant assignment, even though our planet earth is, in comparison to the vast creation of the universe, a mere speck of dust. The time had come for God to create intelligent fleshly creatures who could think and act as He did, in a miniature way. “In God’s image he created him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27</a>) <span id="page266" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="266" data-before-text="266"></span>There is no indication that these creatures were to be anywhere else in the universe.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page52" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="52" data-before-text="52"></span><strong>This Is a Time of Judgment</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">How is mankind being judged today? Upon what bases is judgment rendered? What will be the outcome?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">YOU may not realize it, but you are on trial for your life. What you do and what you say can bring either a favorable or an unfavorable judgment. Should it prove unfavorable, the execution of it will cost you your life. The responsibility for passing such judgment does not rest on the shoulders of secret police, politically appointed judges or judges elected by popular vote. Jehovah God, your Creator and the supreme Ruler of the universe, is your Judge.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If your conduct toward his laws and purposes has not been proper, you cannot obtain a favorable decision by resorting to bribery, deception or clever argument. He cannot be bribed, and there is no way you can hide anything from him. He knows your innermost thoughts. “There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” “As for Jehovah, he will sit to time indefinite, firmly establishing his throne for judgment itself. And he himself will judge the productive land in righteousness; he will judicially try national groups in uprightness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 9:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It is not necessary for you to stand before the great Judge personally as you would before a human judge in order to be under judgment. From his lofty throne in the heavens he can turn his attention toward the earth and judge humans from there. “His own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men. Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one, and anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 11:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>JUDGMENT PERIODS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">There have been certain periods in human history when Jehovah God has turned his attention toward the earth for judgment. The people he put under surveillance were judged by their course of action toward his righteous principles and purposes. The first human pair, for example, were under divine judgment, but their bad conduct brought them a sentence of death.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The people who lived immediately before the flood of Noah’s day passed through a judgment period that ended when the Flood swept most of them out of existence. Because of their wicked disregard for God and his purposes he judged them adversely. “He did not hold back from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a deluge upon a world of ungodly people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:5</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">There is nothing in the Bible to suggest that these people were or shall be punished in a fiery hell. From the time of Adam to this very day the punishment for wickedness has not been conscious torment in a fiery hell but rather death—a cutting off from life. “For the wages sin pays is death.” “Jehovah is guarding all those loving him, but all the wicked ones he will annihilate.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 145:20</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">After mentioning the world destroyed by the Flood and the cities of Sodom and <span id="page53" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>Gomorrah that were destroyed by fire, Peter states: “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment to be cut off.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:9</a>) These two outstanding judgment periods were proofs of this. The wicked people in each period were reserved, or allowed to remain, throughout their judgment periods until the day of their execution. But persons of godly devotion who had received a favorable judgment were preserved.</p>

<strong>Who Sees the New World’s King at the Temple?</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Just as foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 11:11, 12</a>, the anointed remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses were revived from the death state into which the enemy had forced them. God did not let them be destroyed during World War I. He revived them by his spirit in 1919. But the religious clergy died as to God’s true service, like the rich man <span id="page209" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="209" data-before-text="209"></span>in Haʹdes. It was then that the remnant caught the vision of the postwar service for God at his temple. Isaiah, picturing them, said: “I saw the Lord<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1951242/1">b</a> sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa. 6:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) As a comparison of Bible prophecy with historical facts shows, Jehovah God as represented by his Messenger of the covenant, his King, came to the temple in 1918. That was therefore “the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:17</a>, <em>NW</em>) Hence the remnant as well as Christendom which professes to be God’s house were brought to the temple. But Christendom did not get the vision; she was disclosed to be leprous because of her sin of rebellion against the Kingdom. As for the anointed remnant, they discerned with greater appreciation that Jehovah God was now reigning by his enthroned King Jesus Christ. The wrath of the nations which they vented in waging World War I and in persecuting the witnesses of God’s kingdom was proof of that fact. So they appreciated it was now a time of judgment for them. “Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, his throne is in heaven; his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 11:4</a>, <em>AS</em>) His high and uplifted throne indicates that he is the Supreme Authority of the universe, the rightful Sovereign and Judge of all creatures.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">15. By whom was he attended at the temple? How was this most fitting?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Isaiah describes the vision of Jehovah throning at his temple: “Over him stood seraphim, each having six wings, with two of which he covered his face, with two he covered his loins, and with two he hovered in flight.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isa. 6:2</a>, <em>AT</em>) It being a time of judgment, it was very fitting that Jehovah should be attended by seraphim, for the name of these spirit creatures means “fiery ones; burning ones”. This quality about them reflects that “Jehovah thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God”, that is, toward his enemies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deut. 4:24</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">De 9:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:29</a>) Execution of his judgment as by fire as well as the cleansing of his faithful remnant as by fire was at hand. The seraphim were most respectful of Jehovah’s person. Keenly sensing his holiness, they covered their faces and lower limbs with their wings, just as officials in the most dignified Oriental court in ancient times would do in the king’s presence. Because of their closeness to the Sovereign of the universe they were all the more self-effacing in order not to distract from his personal glory. But here Isaiah, a creature lower than the angels, was beholding with wide-open eyes the sight of the Most High God. It is now a solemn thought for us to reflect that Jehovah God is at his temple of judgment attended by these fiery seraphim. It is a most dignified, solemn, awesome circumstance.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">16. What is the import of what the seraphim are saying?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> “And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isa. 6:3</a>, <em>AS</em>) In thus continually crying out this refrain on God’s holiness, these seraphim match the four living creatures whom John saw in his vision of Jehovah on the celestial throne. “And as for these four living creatures, each one of them respectively has six wings; round about and underneath they are full of eyes. And they have no rest day and night as they say: ‘Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951242/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rev. 4:1-8</a>, <em>NW</em>) Their saying “holy” three times makes this quality very emphatic. It shows that the Almighty God is inherently devoted to righteousness, incapable <span id="page210" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="210" data-before-text="210"></span>of doing anything wrong. This holy quality vindicates him against all the false charges that Satan the Devil has leveled at Jehovah God. For this reason his temple must be a clean, holy place and those who want to serve him there must also be holy in a godlike devotion to what is right, pure and good. That is why, too, the earth over which He has taken his great power to reign by Christ must be made a holy place. The earth is his footstool, and it will be made glorious, for it was with prophetic import that the seraphim kept calling to one another, “The whole earth is full of his glory.”</p>

Some prefer to spend their leisure time quietly at home​—reading a book, listening to music, watching a movie, or browsing the Internet. Others enjoy being more active with friends​—hiking, swimming, or playing a game. Whatever our preference is, we need to make sure that our choice of entertainment is <strong>“acceptable to the Lord.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021253/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:10</a>) It is important that we understand this because a lot of popular entertainment features things that Jehovah hates, such as violence, sexual immorality, or spiritism. (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021253/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5</a>.)

As we learned in a previous lesson, “the one walking with the wise will become wise.” On the other hand, if we regularly associate with people who have no love for God’s standards, we “will fare badly.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021253/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>.</p>

It moves lovers of God to avoid any form of entertainment that may foster a taste for violence.

<strong>The Source of Evil Exposed!</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">You also need to shield your heart from the love of violence, for the Devil knows that “anyone <em>loving</em> violence [Jehovah] certainly hates.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007401/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5</a>) Satan does not have to turn you into a bloodthirsty villain to make you an enemy of God; he simply needs to nurture within you a <em>love</em> of violence. It is no coincidence that violence, often with occult themes, saturates the popular media. The Nephilim are dead and gone, but their traits and behavior are very much alive! Does your choice of entertainment show that you resist Satan’s schemes?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007401/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one,” wrote King David of ancient Israel, “and anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005689/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5</a>) The original-language word for “hate” can carry the thought of being “one who is an enemy.” Therefore, anyone loving violence is making himself an enemy of God. The question that we need to consider, then, is: Could playing certain computer games nurture a love of violence?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Violent computer games glorify the use of weapons. They often train the user in the art of war. The magazine <em>The Economist</em> stated: “America’s military is relying more heavily on computer games as training tools. Some games which the military uses are off-the-shelf products.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">True, those who play violent computer games are not doing harm to real people. But what does this choice of entertainment indicate about what may be happening to their hearts? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005689/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005689/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 6:45</a>) What would you conclude about a person who enjoyed stabbing, shooting, maiming, and killing imaginary people? What if this person spent many hours each week indulging those violent fantasies, becoming almost addicted to such games? At the very least, you would conclude that he was fostering a love of violence, just as a person who watches pornography is cultivating immoral desires.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005689/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 5:27-29</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How intensely does Jehovah hate someone who loves violence? David said that Jehovah “certainly hates” him. In Noah’s day, Jehovah demonstrated the intensity of his hatred for those who love violence. Jehovah said to Noah: “The end of all flesh has come before me, because the earth is full of violence as a result of them; and here I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005689/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 6:13</a>) The true God destroyed an entire world of mankind because of their violent ways. He preserved only Noah and his family​—eight individuals who did not love violence.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005689/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:5</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah, a Dependable Refuge</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What was David’s answer? “Jehovah is in his holy temple. Jehovah​—in the heavens is his throne. His own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men. Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one, and anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates. He will rain down upon the wicked ones traps, fire and sulphur and a scorching wind, as the portion of their cup. For Jehovah is righteous; he <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>does love righteous acts. The upright are the ones that will behold his face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979129/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 11:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">David was certain that his looking to Jehovah as his refuge would not be in vain. He realized that the Most High, the One who has his throne in the highest heavens, is watching. Jehovah’s eyes penetrate to the very heart of things. Nothing escapes his notice. Since Jehovah’s eyes are on the righteous, he knows what they need and, therefore, can come to their rescue. On the other hand, the Most High hates men of violence and, hence, his examining them makes their calamity certain. The time is bound to come when the wicked will be forced to drink the death-dealing potion of Jehovah’s judgments, comparable to traps, fire, sulphur and a scorching wind that withers vegetation. There will be no escaping from the execution of God’s judgments. It will be as if traps or snares are falling like rain from the sky above. Because Jehovah is himself righteous and loves righteous acts, the upright will experience a grand salvation. It will prove to be as if God’s face is turned toward them in an expression of love and approval. Thus they will see God’s face as persons enjoying his blessing and favor.</p>

<strong>Proper Viewpoint of Discipline</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Reinstatement is not just a matter of waiting for a specified time to elapse and then making the proper request in writing to the congregation. No; during the period of excommunication the wrongdoer’s heart condition, his basic attitude, must undergo a profound change. The sinner must fully <span id="page473" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="473" data-before-text="473"></span>realize the gravity of his wicked course and the great reproach he has brought upon Jehovah and his organization. He must feel cut to the heart. But he must do more. He must go farther than mere recognition of a wrong and feeling sorry. He must repent, which means to feel such sorrow for sin or fault as to be disposed to change one’s life for the better. There has to be a converting or changing of his entire course of action. Yes, he must “set matters straight” in harmony with God’s righteous requirements. Then he can approach the congregation committee, acknowledge his wrong, and give evidence he is living a clean life and will continue to do so. In this way he will prove that he is worthy of receiving Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and be reinstated.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If these necessary evidences of sorrow and change are present, then his reinstatement could be considered by the congregation committee after sufficient time had elapsed, which in most cases is at least a year.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>WHY CONFESS?</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">When the Christian considers the Scriptural aspects of disfellowshiping it should make him keenly aware of the displeasure God expresses toward persistent wrongdoing. It should make him realize just how serious a thing it is to practice sin. It should make him reaffirm his determination never to pursue a course of wrongdoing. How disastrous it is to be disfellowshiped! What great reproach is brought upon God, upon God’s congregation, upon the individual concerned and upon his family members!</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">With such grave consequences involved, a few who have fallen into sin might be tempted to reason this way: ‘Well, I know I have done wrong, but I also know that if I tell anyone about it I might be disfellowshiped. I’ve learned how terrible this can be, and I don’t want to go through that. I had better not tell anyone about this. Nobody will ever know, and all that shame will be avoided.’</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Such reasoning ignores many things. One is God’s quality of mercy. Another is the benefit that comes from being disciplined by Jehovah. The heart attitude of such a person is wrong. His reasoning is fallacious and dangerous to himself. In the first place he does not appreciate that this will begin to sear his conscience and open the way for more wrongdoing. Since he “got away” with it once, it will be easier to do again. The fallacy is that his sin is not against just another person, or against just God’s congregation. His sin is against Jehovah! While it might be possible to hide a course of wickedness from other people for a while, it is not possible to hide it from Jehovah!</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jehovah observes what men do. “Jehovah is in his holy temple. Jehovah—in the heavens is his throne. His own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men. Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963567/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 11:4, 5</a>) “The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, keeping watch upon the bad ones and the good ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963567/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 15:3</a>) “For my eyes are upon all their ways. They have not been concealed from before me, neither has their error been hid from in front of my eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963567/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jer. 16:17</a>) “As for Jehovah, he sees what the heart is.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963567/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:7</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">From this it is evident that a person overtaken in serious violations of Jehovah’s laws should not try to “get away” with sin and think he will be free from Jehovah’s discipline. “God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963567/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 4:6</a>) Jehovah will oppose any who sin grievously and who then try to remain in his clean organization without confessing their error <span id="page474" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="474" data-before-text="474"></span>to the visible authorities in the Christian congregation. The person who falls into sin, but who wants to do what is right, should go to the overseer of the congregation and make an honest confession of his transgression. Said the Bible writer James: “Therefore openly confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may get healed.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963567/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jas. 5:16</a>.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page52" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="52" data-before-text="52"></span><strong>This Is a Time of Judgment</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">How is mankind being judged today? Upon what bases is judgment rendered? What will be the outcome?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">YOU may not realize it, but you are on trial for your life. What you do and what you say can bring either a favorable or an unfavorable judgment. Should it prove unfavorable, the execution of it will cost you your life. The responsibility for passing such judgment does not rest on the shoulders of secret police, politically appointed judges or judges elected by popular vote. Jehovah God, your Creator and the supreme Ruler of the universe, is your Judge.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If your conduct toward his laws and purposes has not been proper, you cannot obtain a favorable decision by resorting to bribery, deception or clever argument. He cannot be bribed, and there is no way you can hide anything from him. He knows your innermost thoughts. “There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” “As for Jehovah, he will sit to time indefinite, firmly establishing his throne for judgment itself. And he himself will judge the productive land in righteousness; he will judicially try national groups in uprightness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 9:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It is not necessary for you to stand before the great Judge personally as you would before a human judge in order to be under judgment. From his lofty throne in the heavens he can turn his attention toward the earth and judge humans from there. “His own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men. Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one, and anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 11:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>JUDGMENT PERIODS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">There have been certain periods in human history when Jehovah God has turned his attention toward the earth for judgment. The people he put under surveillance were judged by their course of action toward his righteous principles and purposes. The first human pair, for example, were under divine judgment, but their bad conduct brought them a sentence of death.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The people who lived immediately before the flood of Noah’s day passed through a judgment period that ended when the Flood swept most of them out of existence. Because of their wicked disregard for God and his purposes he judged them adversely. “He did not hold back from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a deluge upon a world of ungodly people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:5</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">There is nothing in the Bible to suggest that these people were or shall be punished in a fiery hell. From the time of Adam to this very day the punishment for wickedness has not been conscious torment in a fiery hell but rather death—a cutting off from life. “For the wages sin pays is death.” “Jehovah is guarding all those loving him, but all the wicked ones he will annihilate.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 145:20</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">After mentioning the world destroyed by the Flood and the cities of Sodom and <span id="page53" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>Gomorrah that were destroyed by fire, Peter states: “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment to be cut off.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:9</a>) These two outstanding judgment periods were proofs of this. The wicked people in each period were reserved, or allowed to remain, throughout their judgment periods until the day of their execution. But persons of godly devotion who had received a favorable judgment were preserved.</p>

<strong>You Can Find Wholesome Entertainment</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In selecting their entertainment, Christians will want to be guided by Bible principles. For example, the psalmist David wrote: “Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one, and anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997363/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5</a>) And Paul wrote to the Colossians: “Deaden, therefore, your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness . . . Put them all away from you, wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997363/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997363/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Much entertainment that is available today clearly violates this inspired counsel. ‘But I would never <em>do</em> the things I see depicted on-screen,’ some might object. That may be so. But even if your entertainment does not indicate the kind of person you will become, it may reveal something about the kind of person you already are. It might, for instance, tell whether you are among those who are “loving violence” or who are preoccupied with ‘fornication, sexual appetite, covetousness, and obscene talk’ or whether you are among those who truly “hate what is bad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997363/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>.</p>

On the other hand, the Most High hates men of violence and, hence, his examining them makes their calamity certain. The time is bound to come when the wicked will be forced to drink the death-dealing potion of Jehovah’s judgments, comparable to traps, fire, sulphur and a scorching wind that withers vegetation. There will be no escaping from the execution of God’s judgments. It will be as if traps or snares are falling like rain from the sky above. Because Jehovah is himself righteous and loves righteous acts, the upright will experience a grand salvation. It will prove to be as if God’s face is turned toward them in an expression of love and approval. Thus they will see God’s face as persons enjoying his blessing and favor.</p>

There will be no escaping from the execution of God’s judgments. It will be as if traps or snares are falling like rain from the sky above. Because Jehovah is himself righteous and loves righteous acts, the upright will experience a grand salvation. It will prove to be as if God’s face is turned toward them in an expression of love and approval. Thus they will see God’s face as persons enjoying his blessing and favor.</p>

<strong>Appreciating the Salvation of Our God</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> The ransom should motivate us to positive acts, works of faith that reflect our heartfelt thanks for all that Jehovah and Christ have done for us. Thus we may be assured of being among those mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973564/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Psalm 11:7</a>: “For Jehovah is righteous; he does love righteous acts. The upright are the ones that will behold his face.” Today there are more than one and a half million of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth who are performing righteous acts on behalf of others of honest heart. Their ministry includes calling at others’ homes, freely teaching them the Bible and showing them the way to the everlasting life that may be gained only through accurate knowledge concerning God, Christ and the ransom provision. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973564/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">John 17:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973564/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 14:6</a>) All this ministry is performed voluntarily and without thought of material reward.

<strong>Why Expect God to Listen to Prayer?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The fact that God commands us to pray and fills his Word, the Bible, with examples of his servants praying should suffice to show that they can expect God to listen to prayers. But, it may be asked, Why? Why should this great Eternal One, the Most High and Universal Sovereign, listen to the prayers of his servants? One overriding or compelling reason is that the reputation of his name is involved. Thus Moses repeatedly pleaded with God successfully on the basis of God’s name and fame being involved: “Why, O Jehovah, should your anger blaze against your people. . . ? Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought them out in order to kill them’?” “Were you to put this people to death as one man, then the <span id="page71" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="71" data-before-text="71"></span>nations who have heard of your fame would certainly say this, ‘Because of Jehovah’s not being able to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them he proceeded to slaughter them in the wilderness.”’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 32:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Num. 14:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Thus also Jehovah listened to Joshua when, after the defeat at Ai, he prayed: “Excuse me, O Jehovah, but what can I say after Israel has turned his back before his enemies? And the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will certainly surround us and cut our name off from the earth; and what will you do for your great name?” The same was true of the prayer that Hezekiah, faithful king of the two-tribe kingdom of Judah, offered when confronted with the taunts of the sneering king of Assyria, Sennacherib: “And now, O Jehovah our God, save us, please, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Jehovah, are God alone.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 7:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:19</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then again, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 79:9</a>, we read the prayer: “Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name.” And so did Daniel pray, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 9:19</a>: “O Jehovah, do hear. . . . Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people.” Many more examples could be given, but these should be sufficient to show that Jehovah God can be expected to listen to prayer, particularly when it is related to the vindication of his name.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>BECAUSE OF HAVING KEPT INTEGRITY</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Another reason why God’s servants can expect God to listen to their prayers is his love of righteousness: “Jehovah is righteous; he does love righteous acts.” Because of this we read: “Jehovah is far away from the wicked ones, but the prayer of the righteous ones he hears.” Those who follow an upright course can come to God on the basis of their having kept integrity with God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 11:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Prov. 15:29</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Thus Job made an eloquent plea to God on the basis of his having followed a righteous course. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job Chapters 29-31</a>) Likewise King David, in praying for God’s blessing at the time of gathering materials for the building of the temple, said: “I well know, O my God, that you are an examiner of the heart, and that it is in rectitude that you take pleasure. I, for my part, in the uprightness of my heart have voluntarily offered all these things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:17</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In the same vein we find Nehemiah praying: “Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.” The writer of the letter to the Hebrews, doubtless the apostle Paul, likewise shows the connection between purposeful prayer and right conduct: “Carry on prayer for us, for we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” In fact, this very same principle is implied in the model prayer Jesus gave his disciples: “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.” Yes, because of Jehovah’s love for righteousness all who are lovers of God’s righteousness and seek to practice it can expect God to listen to their prayers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 13:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Matt. 6:12</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>PRAYING ON THE BASIS OF INHERITED SIN</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">One of the basic requests imperfect creatures can make in their prayers is that God may forgive them their sins. As the apostle John expresses it: “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 John 1:9</a>.</p>

<strong>Maintaining Unity in Difficult Times</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> In fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 24</a>, much persecution has befallen Jehovah’s witnesses in this “time of the end,” so much so that it has not gone unnoticed by the world. Today it is particularly difficult for Jehovah’s witnesses <span id="page306" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="306" data-before-text="306"></span>to do their Christian work in totalitarian states, which bring pressure and persecution upon them. By God’s strength, they endure it. They do not rebel against the political authority, they do not retaliate, because they are faithful Christians and not revolutionaries or counter-revolutionaries. They do not expect salvation from any political system, whatever it may be, including democracy, but exclusively from God’s kingdom. God’s kingdom alone will make all things new.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 21:5</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> If it is important for Jehovah’s witnesses to do their best at all times in maintaining their unity in general, it is even more so in times of special stress and persecution, when the work has to be done underground. Why is this so?</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12. What may happen when the work comes under ban?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> If the work is banned in a country, such as in Romania, Hungary or Russia, this has an immediate effect on the correspondence with the head office in Brooklyn. It may be that no letters can be exchanged for months. In the dictator country itself practically all correspondence between the congregations and the responsible brothers ceases too. No postman comes to the door to bring the Society’s magazines or its letters of instruction and information. The spiritual food, which under normal circumstances reaches the congregations and individuals so abundantly, all of a sudden becomes scarce. Much of it probably was confiscated by the police. The Kingdom Halls are closed and very likely there is no extensive library of Watch Tower publications anywhere that can easily be consulted.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">13, 14.

It may well be that the overseer of the congregation and the responsible brothers from the branch office are deprived of their liberty and sit somewhere in prison. Other brothers have to take their places who may perhaps not be known to all the brothers personally. There are no more meetings on a large scale, but only in small underground groups. It goes without saying that all this exposes the unity of God’s people to great stress, and the necessity of doing everything possible to maintain unity cannot be overemphasized.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> A Latin saying goes <em>divide et impera</em> and it means “divide and rule.” This principle oftentimes is followed in totalitarian states, where the government has tried to smash the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses.

How have some Witnesses resisted temptation?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> For example, some persons in such totalitarian lands have tried to win different brothers with flattery, by telling them how great an advantage it would be for them to cooperate with the government and forget their Christian principles, instead of being so “extreme,” dogmatic and stubborn and therefore suffering punishment by the government. Brothers have been offered a responsible position by the government in the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses, and, if accepted, all would be in perfect order, so the government said. But the brothers refused to accept such an untheocratic offer. One answered: “I am not for sale.” They knew that an appointment to service in the theocratic organization could not come from any worldly government, but only through the organization itself. They withstood flattery.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 12:2</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">16.

These responsible persons were accused of being drunkards, adulterers and traitors. The purpose of these machinations is very clear: these letters were written to create confusion and to undermine their trust in the brothers in charge. Of course, these letters did not say that the secret police wrote and sent them. The envelopes showed, rather, addresses of faithful brothers as the senders, to give the impression that the letters were written by brothers. In another country the secret police even produced falsified copies of a <em>Watchtower</em> magazine, with the same purpose of confusing the brothers. In drawing up this counterfeit issue of <em>The Watchtower,</em> articles from the genuine <em>Watchtower</em> magazine were taken and then twisted so as to serve the enemy’s purpose. But the brothers got to see the difference, and this scheme failed.</p>

<strong>Keeping the Organization of Public Servants Pure, Chaste</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The Christian apostle Paul deeply appreciated this fact. It was well that he did so, for he was one of the most prominent public servants on earth of the Most High God. Paul knew that the chasteness of his private life ought to recommend to others the Christian message that he preached and taught. Also, the purity of what he taught ought to recommend his message to others and not be a stumbling block or hindrance. It ought to lead to a clean organization. In order to live, to preach and to serve for the unhindered advancement of his message of salvation, Paul was willing to suffer anything. So, after referring to himself and Timothy as ambassadors <span id="page686" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="686" data-before-text="686"></span>substituting for Christ, Paul made this statement:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, that our ministry might not be found fault with; but in every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers, by the endurance of much, by tribulations, by cases of need, by difficulties, by beatings, by prisons, by disorders, by labors, by sleepless nights, by times without food, by purity [or, chastity], by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by holy spirit, by love free from hypocrisy, by truthful speech, by God’s power.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964844/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964844/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 5:20</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"> 9, 10. (a) How would Paul’s companion Timothy keep himself chaste with respect to other men appointed to a congregational office? (b) Who else would benefit from his chasteness in this regard?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Take note of Paul’s mention of purity or chastity. In this he included his missionary companion Timothy with himself. He insisted that this younger man Timothy be pure or chaste personally and as respects other persons. Under God’s direction Paul clothed this younger man with the authority to do the appointing of overseers and ministerial servants in newly organized congregations. If Timothy did not exercise caution in appointing men to office, and if he let his appointments be influenced by some selfish personal bias of his, he might put into office men who would commit sins as public servants. He would share the blame for their sins and how those sins affected the congregation and the Christian cause.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> By taking good care and impartially striving to put in office men truly capable and of good, reliable conduct, Timothy would keep himself free and pure from sharing the blame for another man’s sins in office. Said Paul: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964844/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:22</a>) By not appointing men liable to turn out bad he would not only keep himself chaste and clear of any share in the blame but also keep the congregation chaste. It would not have the bad example of a sinful man set in front of it.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">11, 12. (a) Why did Timothy as a servant who had to pass along instructions to others have to set a right example? (b) In this regard, what did Paul write Timothy?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Timothy had to watch not to pave the way for someone else to set a bad example in office. Besides that, he himself as a public servant had to set a right example worthy of imitation. He was to do more than merely tell other brothers what to do, passing along to them instructions that came from the governing body of God’s earthly organization. He had to show himself worthy of telling others what to do according to organization instructions. In that way he had to add force to his commands and instructions by himself leading an exemplary life. The ripeness of his Christian development both in mind and in spirit would correct any wrong impression on others that his bodily youngness might make. This was the point that Paul made when he wrote to Timothy:</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> “Keep on giving these commands and teaching them. Let no man ever look down on your youth. On the contrary, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness. While I am coming, continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964844/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:11-13</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">13.

<strong>Face</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To <em>‘conceal the face’</em> has a variety of meanings, depending on the circumstance. Jehovah God’s concealing his face often signifies a withdrawal of his favor or his sustaining power. This may be as a consequence of the disobedience of the individual or body of persons involved, such as the nation of Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001482/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Job 34:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001482/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Ps 30:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001482/31/2" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Isa 54:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001482/31/3" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> 59:2</a>) In some cases it may denote that Jehovah refrains from revealing himself by action or reply, awaiting his own due time.

<strong>How Long Will God Forget Me?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span id="page26" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>This is the way David came to feel, perhaps when experiencing persecution from King Saul or, later, during the time of his son Absalom’s revolt. Regardless of the period involved, David had trials for such a long time that he found himself in a very low state, wondering whether Jehovah had forgotten him. He was prompted to exclaim: “How long, O Jehovah, will you forget me? Forever? How long will you conceal your face from me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979168/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 13:1</a>) It seemed to David as if Jehovah had concealed his face in displeasure, not intervening in his behalf. So he further asks: “How long shall I set resistance in my soul, grief in my heart by day?” This may mean that he wondered how long he would be left to work out his own means of resistance to the distressing circumstances in which he found himself and how long his grief would last day in and day out.</p>

<strong>Awake to Our Responsibility</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Today each dedicated Christian has certain Kingdom interests that he can care for. While the Kingdom talents or belongings of the Master have been committed to the spiritual remnant, all servants of God have the opportunity of using the knowledge and service prospects they receive wisely. What do you do with your talents? Are you burying them, or are you using them and thereby receiving the joy that comes with Jehovah’s blessing? Jesus summarized this by showing that the really happy ones are the alert ones, the active ones, those who keep awake to their responsibilities. “For to everyone that has, more will be given and he will have abundance; <span id="page87" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="87" data-before-text="87"></span>but as for him that does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 25:29</a>) So let us use, increase and treasure our privileges of Kingdom service.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">15. What illustration shows the need for wakefulness?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Since our Kingdom ministry is a trust from God, we must be alert to safeguard it. If you were given a large sum of money to take to the bank for your employer, you certainly would not feel like sleeping on the park bench on the way. You would be alert, on guard, to make sure nothing went wrong for which you would be held accountable. That is just how we should feel about the trust of our Christian ministry. It involves the loss, not just of a sum of money, but of life. Jesus gave an illustration on the need for alertness at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 16:15</a>, when he said: “Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his parts of shame.” It was the custom in the days of Israel for the priests and Levites to keep watch at the temple at night to guard against robbery or intruders. Any who were caught asleep when the Officer of the Temple Mount made the rounds to see that all was well were stripped and beaten. Those priests and Levites pictured the priestly class, the 144,000, of whom a remnant serve as watchmen for the spiritual temple today. So the warning is well taken, not only by them but also by those who serve as companions with them in the ministry, not to be found in neglect of duty or sleeping on the job lest they be stripped of the privilege of service they enjoy as Jehovah’s witnesses by the temple inspector, Christ Jesus.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">16. What experience did the disciples have?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Do not say it would never happen to you. Something similar happened even to the disciples, not once, but three times! It was the evening before Jesus’ death when he went to the spot called Gethsemane to pray. As he continued praying the disciples went to sleep. Then Jesus said to Peter: “Could you men not so much as watch one hour with me? Keep on the watch and praying, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit, of course, is willing, but the flesh is weak.” Jesus was not making excuses for the disciples, but he knew they were tired. No doubt if they had fully understood the events about to take place, the account would not show that the second time he “found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.” But even the third time when he returned from praying Jesus had to tell them: “At such a time as this you are sleeping and taking your rest! Look! the hour has drawn near for the Son of man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 26:40-45</a>) Peter must have learned his lesson well, because later he gave similar counsel to keep awake, saying: “Keep your senses, be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:8</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">17. How can this experience help us?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> While the disciples were not stripped of their privileges of service on this occasion, they must have afterward keenly regretted that they were not alert with Jesus during his last hours. It serves as a good warning to us to be doubly alert in this time of the end not to be similarly rebuked or even lose our service privileges. So do not be found asleep at home when the brothers are meeting together at the Kingdom Hall for prayer or study. Perhaps someone will have to counsel you just as Jesus did the disciples. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 13:3</a>) Instead let us safeguard the wonderful trust we have from Jehovah by continuing to study and meet together and to share in the service to which we have been assigned.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:21, 22</a>.</p>

<strong>Know Jehovah—The Personal God</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>“The Fool” and God</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">“It never occurred to any writer of the OT [Hebrew Scriptures] to prove or argue the existence of God,” says Dr. James Hastings in <em>A Dictionary of the Bible.</em> “It is not according to the spirit of the ancient world in general to deny the existence of God, or to use arguments to prove it. The belief was one natural to the human mind and common to all men.” This does not mean, of course, that all men at that time were God-fearing. Far from it. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997721/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 14:1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997721/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 53:1</a> both mention “the senseless one,” or as the <em>King James Version</em> says, “the fool,” who has said in his heart, “There is no Jehovah.”</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What kind of person is this fool, the man who denies the existence of God? He is not <em>intellectually</em> ignorant. Rather, the Hebrew word <em>na·valʹ</em> points to a <em>moral</em> deficiency. Professor S. R. Driver, in his notes to <em>The Parallel Psalter,</em> says that the fault is “not weakness of reason, but moral and religious insensibility, an invincible lack of sense, or perception.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>The psalmist goes on to describe the moral breakdown that is a result of such an attitude: “They have acted ruinously, they have acted detestably in their dealing. There is no one doing good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997721/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 14:1</a>) Dr. Hastings sums up: “Counting on this absence of God from the world and on impunity, men become corrupt and do abominable deeds.” They openly embrace ungodly principles and discount a personal God to whom they have no wish to be accountable. But such thinking is as foolish and senseless today as it was when the psalmist wrote his words over 3,000 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/418/0">8/1/1973, p. 451</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Do You Really Believe that God Exists?</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MOST of earth’s population profess belief in God. Do you? If so, you may consider the question (“Do you really believe that God exists?”) as directed to others. Perhaps you call to mind <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973560/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 14:1</a>: “The senseless one has said in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah,’” and apply it to atheists and agnostics. But could this verse include more than such persons?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It definitely does. The Hebrew word for “senseless one” indicates <em>moral,</em> not intellectual, deficiency. This psalm, therefore, is not talking primarily about those who openly say, “There is no God,” but, rather, about those who deny God ‘in their heart.’ That is, they do not submit to his rule over their lives. They imply that he lacks power or concern.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">They are much like persons who refuse to acknowledge the authority of a court. The court <em>exists.</em> But they ignore its <em>jurisdiction</em> over them. Therefore, to say “I believe that God exists” has real meaning only if one accepts God’s Word, his authority in one’s life. Do you?</p>

At the same time, suns and planets of incredible size move through space with a speed and precision that stagger the imagination, and that grand system is supposed to have had no designer! Sensible persons appreciate the truth of the words written by Isaiah: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name. Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he [Jehovah] also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964722/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) David similarly exclaimed: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you [Jehovah] have prepared, what is mortal man?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964722/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>) So, too, in our day, honest persons recognize that what modern scientific discoveries and inventions emphasize over and over again is the fundamental truth recorded in Genesis, that “in the beginning God created.” Of those who do not believe this, the psalmist states: “The senseless one has said in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964722/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>SPECULATIONS DISPROVED</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">19, 20.

Some thought giraffes got their long necks by stretching higher and higher for the top leaves of trees, and so their offspring were born with long necks. It was thought that people living near the equator got tanned from the hot sun, and then passed the tan to their children, resulting in dark skin. But then an Austrian, Gregor Mendel, discovered the facts of heredity, which prove such things untrue. He found out about the definite, orderly laws that fixed things from parent to offspring “according to its kind,” just as Genesis had recorded. This made the slow change of one form of life into another impossible, for while it allowed for great variety in color, size and shape, it did not result in new forms of life.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Evolutionists next said that things must have evolved, not by slow changes, but by fast changes in the genes, by mutations.

But no such fossils have been found of creatures whose fins were changing into arms or legs, or whose feet were changing into wings. In short, all the many gaps between family kinds have remained, simply because no connections ever existed! As an article in the London <em>Times</em> (May 19, 1963) on the subject said: “The fossil evidence is really of little help [for evolution] here . . . it is only by a stretch of the imagination that one can visualize a specific transformation of particular specimens . . . into their alleged modern descendants.”</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">22.

In the face of these facts, the slow progress of early man is a disproved assumption, and the idea that an infinitely prolonged period elapsed before civilization appeared cannot be maintained.”</p>

<strong>Exercising Faith Is like Acting with a Title Deed</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Because of Jehovah’s authority, power and reliability, we can have an assurance, or confidence, similar to <span id="page281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="281" data-before-text="281"></span>that of a person who has the title deed to property. Having faith in God’s promises because of his integrity is like having faith that we own property because of possessing a deed to it. It is an assurance that comes because Jehovah has promised it and because he has proved himself completely reliable in fulfilling his promises. This faith in God is best defined for us in the Bible at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1</a> in these words: “Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for.” In the book <em>Word Pictures in the New Testament</em> A. T. Robertson says of this scripture: “We venture to suggest the translation ‘Faith is the title-deed of things hoped for.’” He points out that the Greek word for “assured expectation” has the meaning of what stands under anything, a contract, or a promise. See <em>The Watchtower</em> as of December 15, 1962, page 749, ¶5, 6.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So faith in God is more than a desire or a hope. Faith is something added to hope. It means that we are assured of what God has promised to give us or to do for us, even though we do not see it as yet; it is as good as done, even though not yet actually done. Faith is the absolute assurance that what God says is going to happen <em>will</em> happen.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Faith should not be confused with credulity or wishful thinking. There is a vast difference. Credulity is defined as “a disposition, arising from weakness or ignorance, to believe too readily, especially impossible or absurd things.” To be credulous is to be “easily deceived; gullible.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Much of what passes for faith in the world today is not true faith, but is credulity. Many, without carefully observing and studying God’s ways, jump to hasty conclusions that often are greatly out of harmony with the spirit of divine truth. Acting and teaching according to such credulity dishonors God and brings great reproach upon his name. Many times credulous ones claim to have the strongest “faith.” But what they feel so strongly about often is what God <em>did not</em> say, and they frequently have no inclination to hear or heed what God <em>did</em> say.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">An example of credulity was Adam’s wife, Eve. She believed the serpent in Eden even though she had no evidence that what he spoke was the truth. The outcome was that she “was thoroughly deceived” and lost her life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:14</a>) Millions of people today believe articles of religious faith that are not based on truth. Such credulity will lead to disappointment and even death, as in the case of Eve.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>FIRMLY GROUNDED ON EVIDENCE</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">True faith in God is firmly grounded on evidence and authority. It is the reasonable conclusion derived from examining the facts. These facts that form the basis of evidence come from two sources. One is from what God has created and the other is from what he has revealed.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Reasoning on the established principles of cause and effect, we see in the entire realm of nature the evidences of a Creator. The order and harmony of very small things, such as atoms, as well as the order and harmony of very large things, such as the entire universe, show the intelligent handiwork of a super mind. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a> says: “For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made.” So undeniable is the evidence of an intelligent Creator furnished by nature that the Scriptures state: “The senseless one has said in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">There is much more that serves as a sound basis for our faith. It is the written revelation of God, his Word, the Bible. Such absolute truth that we need as the solid evidence for our faith is found in the Bible. Its internal harmony, the fulfillment of its prophecies, and the corroboration, <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>by historians, archaeologists and others, of the facts it contains, stamp it as being of divine origin and absolutely true as a basis for our faith. God’s Son, Jesus Christ, confirmed this basis for our faith by saying: “Your word is truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 17:17</a>) All that God expects us to believe beyond what he has provided in nature is in his Word. In it he has given us a firm foundation of facts so we can reason on them and form a firm conviction that the things unseen, and as yet not realized, are assured.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/422/0">7/1/1961, pp. 391-392,</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Born to Believe in God</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Not only does science give one reason to believe in God, but it causes one to see the need for a revelation from God about himself. The Bible fills that need. Chemist Roger J. Voskuyl says: “As a scientist, it is more reasonable for me to believe in a Creator than in an eternally existing cosmos. . . . One cannot rightly know God from the natural world alone. The scientist may work for an eternity, but he will <span id="page392" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="392" data-before-text="392"></span>never come to know God and all His attributes. . . . Man is but a creature of a Creator; therefore, man cannot learn about God by investigation of His creation alone, but he needs a special revelation. That special revelation is God’s Word, which has been given in the Scriptures.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Distinguished scientist Warren Weaver said: “I believe that the Bible is the purest revelation we have of the nature and goodness of God.” Physicist and chemist Oscar Leo Brauer writes: “There is Special Divine Revelation. Another name for that is the Bible. Science can establish that a creative act at some time must have taken place, implying the existence of a Divine Intelligence and a Divine Power. Science can also establish that none but a Divine Intelligence could have been the Author of the tremendous, involved and intricate system of laws in the universe. But only the Bible can identify that Divine Intelligence and Power as the God most of us have learned to know about from early childhood—the God who has revealed himself uniquely and supremely in His Son, Jesus Christ.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Bible does what nature cannot do. Nature only submits circumstantial evidence that God exists, but the Bible calls the Creator by name. “This is what The true God, Jehovah, has said, the Creator of the heavens and the grand One stretching them out; the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it. ‘I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to anyone else I shall not give my own glory, neither my praise to graven images.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 42:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>) The psalmist wrote: “That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The inspired apostle Paul tells us that Jehovah’s “invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship.” The psalmist exclaims: “The heavens are declaring the glory of God, and of the work of his hands the expanse is telling. One day after another day causes speech to bubble forth, and one night after another night shows forth knowledge.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ps. 19:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The scales of perfection evident in the creation of the universe imply the existence of an absolute standard and a perfect Being. Regarding Jehovah, the Bible says: “Perfect is his activity.” “God is a God, not of disorder, but of peace.” Order and design in the universe are proof of that fact. The presence of life bespeaks a lifegiver. Jehovah is “the source of life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 32:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Ps. 36:9</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Another fact that stands out in nature is that our God is a Master Creator who loves beauty. The majesty of the sunrise and sunset, the moon and stars, flowers and trees, the gorgeous colors on the scales of a fish and the feathers of a peacock tell us that Jehovah loves beauty. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24</a>) We know too that Jehovah is a loving God, for among men we find the love of a mother for her child, the love of men and women for each other. We also see that falsehood betrays itself and injustice reaps a grim reward. Can we imagine these qualities stemming from an Author who knows nothing of love, righteousness and judgment? No, we cannot. The Bible tells us that “God is love,” that “righteousness and judgment are the established place of his throne.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 John 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps. 97:2</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Nothing can be more true than that God is, as both the Bible and nature so eloquently testify. Therefore, in God’s own Word unbelievers are appropriately called fools and are justly judged inexcusable.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:20</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

Worldly philosophy, theorizing and higher criticism that contradict God’s Word do not build up your faith, your wisdom or your respect for high moral standards.

A like wise course had been chosen by Abraham when he selected a wife for Isaac, Jacob’s father. Abraham told his servant: “I must have you swear by Jehovah, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in among whom I am dwelling, but you will go to my country and to my relatives and you will certainly take a wife for my son, for Isaac.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961483/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 24:3, 4</a>) These men set a good example by seeking good associations in the marriage union.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Since bad companions can exercise an unwholesome influence upon your thinking, what can an unbelieving marriage mate do?

Evidently Abraham and Jacob thought so and avoided Hittite and Canaanite women. Centuries after their day the nation of Israel was warned against marriages with persons such as that who did not worship Jehovah. They were required to follow the example set by Abraham and Jacob. “You must form no marriage alliance with them. Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son. For he will turn your son from following me and they will certainly serve other gods, and Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against you and he will certainly annihilate you in a hurry.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961483/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deut. 7:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">15.

Let not the rich man brag about himself because of his riches.” Why not? “For who makes you to differ from another? Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive? If, now, you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 9:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 4:7</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Wisdom hates pride not only because pride is without logic and sense of fitness of things but, chief of all, because pride is the flouting of the authority of the greatest, wisest, most powerful and most highly exalted Personage in the universe. Pride causes one to oppose the divine will of Jehovah God. That One “opposes the haughty ones,” and warns that “everyone that exalts himself will be humbled.” Pride makes us the enemies of the One that can do the most for us: give us everlasting life in happiness. No wonder wisdom hates pride!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 14:11</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Yes, pride violates all sense of proportion and fitness of things. It shows itself to be entirely without understanding as to the creature’s relationship to his Creator. “The fear of Jehovah is the start of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Most Holy One is what understanding is.” Pride blinds one to the fact that even the most exalted human is but as a grasshopper compared with the Creator and that entire nations are as but drops that fall from an emptied bucket and as the fine dust that collects on the balances.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 9:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Isa. 40:15-17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 22, 23</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Proud, worldly-wise men sedulously try to free themselves from all accountability to their Maker and all sense of obligation toward him. They busy themselves trying to find apparent flaws in the Word of God and in His book of nature. They rationalize, they philosophize and they engage in idle sophistry, all in the vain attempt to prove to themselves and others that this marvelously designed and flawlessly operating universe came into existence by mere chance and operates at random and without a Sustainer. In vain they try to rule out religion’s role in life. How foolish such men and nations show themselves to be! If not before, at Armageddon, all such will be made to know what fools they were.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Wisdom also hates pride because it is disruptive. Pride spurs rivalry and competition instead of harmony and cooperation. On the one hand, pride causes us to refuse to admit a wrong, and on the other hand, it makes us refuse to forgive and forget. How many marriages have been sacrificed on the altar of pride! Pride is one of the chief contributors to delinquency, for it makes parents exasperated with their children instead of patient with them, and it moves children to rebel against their parents, all of which goes contrary to Bible counsel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 6:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Pride also acts as a disruptive force in the Christian congregation. It makes submission to authority irksome and cooperation with one’s fellows difficult. Not allowing any room for pride are Paul’s words: “In showing honor to one another take the lead,” “with lowliness of mind considering that the others are superior to you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 12:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:3</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Truly with good reason wisdom hates pride! Pride makes us the opponents of the Creator, puts barriers between us and our neighbors and interferes with efficiency and the obtaining of desired results. God’s Word is filled with warning examples underscoring the truth that: “Pride is before a crash, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” So be like wisdom; hate pride!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960480/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 16:18</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

However, not only do the majority of men fail to appreciate what they have, but for the most part they ignore the illustrious Designer and Maker of this earth. Many persons choose to be like the senseless one who “has said in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976008/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 14:1</a>.</p>

Any such “comprehension” (<em>syʹne·sis</em>) of worldly ‘intellectual men’ (<em>sy·ne·tos</em>ʹ) becomes foolishness, in vain, when God’s purposes are not considered. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:19, 20</a>, <em>Kingdom Interlinear Translation</em>) The Scriptures, therefore, primarily urge a superior understanding, one that is <em>spiritual,</em> having God as its foundation. No matter how much men may exploit the earth’s resources, exploring its depths and the depths of the seas or studying the skies, they can never by their own efforts find “the place of understanding” and wisdom that leads to successful life in righteousness and happiness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Job 28:1-21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Such understanding is ‘better than silver’ and can bring the desired future that fleeting worldly riches and honor fail to bring.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Prov. 16:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/39/2" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 23:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/39/3" data-bid="40-4" class="b"> Ps. 49:6-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/39/4" data-bid="40-5" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/39/5" data-bid="40-6" class="b"> 20</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING INVOLVES MIND AND HEART</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The things perceived by man’s senses, such as sight and hearing, are interpreted by the brain, and understanding is therefore connected with the mental faculties. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Job 6:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 9:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/40/2" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 13:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/40/3" data-bid="41-4" class="b"> 23:8, 9</a>.) But the Scriptures show that understanding in its more vital sense involves the heart as well. As Jesus said to his disciples: “Do you not yet perceive and get the meaning? Do you have your hearts dull of understanding? ‘Though having eyes, do you not see; and though having ears, do you not hear?’ And do you not remember?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Mark 8:17-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> compare 12:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 33</a>.) So there is interaction of mind and heart in considering, analyzing, reasoning, pondering, meditating. But the heart is the key factor, for, even though the evidence be very powerful and abundant, there will be no true understanding of its significance if persons do not “get the thought [or “the sense of it”] with their hearts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">John 12:37-40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> Matt. 13:14-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/42/3" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> Isa. 6:9, 10</a>) By God’s help, one can come to “understand heart,” that is, to learn right motive and also be able to discern bad motives, one’s own or those of others (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Prov. 8:5</a>), and by adhering to right motivation can avoid being distracted, misled or sidetracked into a devious and foolish course, and instead can be upright and head straight for one’s goal.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Prov. 15:21</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>RELATIONSHIP TO KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Understanding must be based on knowledge, and works with knowledge, though it is itself more than mere knowledge. The extent and worth of one’s understanding is measurably affected by the quantity and quality of one’s knowledge. Knowledge is acquaintance with facts, and the greatest and most fundamental fact is God, his existence, his invincible purpose, his ways. Understanding enables the person to relate the knowledge he acquires to God’s purpose and standards and thereby assess or evaluate such knowledge. The “understanding heart is one that searches for knowledge”; it is not satisfied with a mere superficial view but seeks to get the full picture. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Prov. 15:14</a>) Knowledge must become ‘pleasant to one’s very soul’ if discernment is to safeguard one from perversion and deception.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Prov. 2:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/46/1" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 18:15</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:1-6</a> shows that the “man of understanding is the one who acquires skillful direction, to understand a proverb and a puzzling saying, the words of wise persons and their riddles.” These must not be things said merely to pass the time away in idle conversation, for wise persons would not customarily waste time in such manner, but must refer to instruction, questions and problems that discipline and train the mind and heart in right principles, thereby equipping the learner for wise action in the future. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Psalm 49:3, 4</a>.) Knowledge and understanding together bring wisdom, which is the “prime thing,” the ability to bring a fund of knowledge and keen understanding to bear on problems with successful results. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Prov. 4:7</a>) The person who is rightly motivated seeks understanding, not out of mere curiosity or to exalt himself, but for the very purpose of acting in wisdom; ‘wisdom is before his <span id="page1625" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1625" data-before-text="1625"></span>face.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Prov. 17:24</a>) He is not like those in the apostle Paul’s day who assumed to be teachers of others but were “puffed up with pride, not understanding anything,” unwisely letting themselves become “mentally diseased over questionings and debates about words,” things that produce disunity and a host of bad results.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014404/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:3-5</a>; see KNOWLEDGE; WISDOM.</p>

<strong>Jehovah—Our Best Friend</strong><br/><h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>WHO WILL BE ‘A GUEST IN JEHOVAH’S TENT’?</strong></h2>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong><strong> According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014126/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 15:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014126/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 5</a>, what does Jehovah require of us if we are to be his friends?</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> For Jehovah to be our Friend, however, we must meet certain conditions. As recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014126/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 15</a>, David sang about what is required for us to be ‘a guest in Jehovah’s tent,’ that is, to be a friend of God.

With regard to these matters, David said of a guest in Jehovah’s tent: “He does not slander with his tongue . . . He does not accept a bribe against the innocent.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014126/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 15:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014126/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p>

<strong>Make Friends for Yourselves</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> How, then, do we use riches or material goods to make friends with God? Not to bribe God but to <em>glorify</em> God! God owns the whole world, and “the silver is mine, and the gold is mine,” says Jehovah. “To me belongs every wild animal of the forest, the beasts upon a thousand mountains.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Hag. 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Ps. 50:10</a>) So we could not enrich God materially, but we can use our resources to glorify God, by telling others of his purposes, by giving him exclusive devotion and loyal love.

This matter of making friends with God and his Son is urgent because this world is now in its “time of the end,” and will soon pass away at God’s war of Armageddon. Now is the time to show that we are friendly toward God. Now is the time to get all the help we can in winning God’s friendship. That is why we need to associate regularly with those who love and obey God, those whom Jesus Christ called “my friends.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Luke 12:4</a>) By associating with the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, thousands of persons are learning the course to take to make friends for themselves ‘by means of the unrighteous riches, so that, when such fail, they may receive them into the everlasting dwelling places.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Luke 16:9</a>.</p>

What an awesome privilege! How can imperfect humans possibly qualify to be God’s friends and guests?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The 15th Psalm answers this question. It mentions ten specific requirements for those desiring to be God’s friends and guests. Let us consider these requirements one by one, starting with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 15 verse 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>“He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness”</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Abraham’s offspring flourished greatly because Abraham was morally faultless in walking before Jehovah.

Others cheat on school tests or falsify tax returns. Such actions betray a lack of love for what is true. But truthfulness and upright acts come from the very hearts of God’s friends. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 15:18-20</a>) They are not devious or deceptive.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 6:16-19</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The apostle Paul wrote: “Do not be lying to one another.

<strong>Do You Keep Your Word?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">One may say, “But I didn’t know what I was getting into!” The real question here is: Whose fault was it? Was there fraud or deception on the other person’s side? If not, then if you do not back out but endure whatever hardness fulfilling your word requires, you learn a valuable lesson, one you will remember. That is: <em>Think before you talk, before you give your word</em>. Then, when you speak, <em>mean what you say.</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 10:19</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">To say “yes” to something simply because you think it will please someone​—but without first thinking out the consequences—​can get you into difficulty. By contrast, if you are careful about making promises, if you think matters through and consider how they will affect your future life, then it will be much easier to keep your word once you have committed yourself. You will have prepared your heart and mind to be true to your word.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Naturally, you cannot foresee everything. Circumstances may change between the time of giving your word and the time of carrying it out, or even during the period of carrying it out. But if the other person has not proved false to his or her part, why should you prove false?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Showing God’s view on this, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 15</a> raises the question as to what kind of person God accepts as his “guest” and then answers, saying: “He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness, and speaking the truth in his heart. . . . He has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 15:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">It is not surprising that God counts as his friends only those who keep their word. Why so? Because he himself does this unfailingly. That is why Joshua could say to the nation of Israel: “You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>) The Bible is largely a record of Jehovah’s kept promises. His trueness in the past is what gives us such confidence of future blessings in fulfillment of his promises.</p>

It also makes for contentment and happiness. That is why we read: “There exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.” “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 18:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17:17</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963329/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What better friendship could anyone cultivate than that with Jehovah God? Surely, all that can be said in praise of true friendship applies to friendship with him, and that to the superlative degree.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How can we gain that much-prized friendship with God? To gain his friendship we must first take in knowledge of him and his purposes. Then we must exercise faith in that knowledge by dedicating ourselves to do his will. “Without faith it is impossible to please him well, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” By devoting our all to God we will be heeding Jesus’ command: “Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 16:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> John 17:3</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How can we keep God’s friendship once we have gained it? King David, who himself was a friend of God, answers: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain? He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart. He has not slandered with his tongue. To his companion he has done nothing bad, and no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness take in ever so many things. It means, first of all, that we remain loyal to Jehovah God. It means giving him “exclusive devotion.” It means to “love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.” To keep our friendship with Jehovah we must be constant, dependable, loyal, and keep walking with him as did Enoch and other faithful men of old.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 20:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mark 12:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Gen. 5:24</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This means that we must guard against all improper friendships, for will not such make us the enemies of God? Guarded against also must be the love of money, for we cannot serve two masters, and especially not when the two are opposed to each other as are God and Riches.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 16:13</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We must also trust God implicitly and always submit to him if we would walk faultlessly before him, enjoying his friendship. That means consulting him in all our ways, letting him direct our paths. Never do we want to push ahead presumptuously with our own ideas or with the private opinions of others. Reading in God’s Word or law regularly will help us to keep proper perspective as to our relationship with our Maker and with our neighbor, for were not the kings of Israel commanded to do the same for the same reasons? Nor may we overlook talking with God in prayer. All such will help us to walk modestly with God and so keep from losing God’s friendship by acting presumptuously.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 17:18-20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness also mean keeping holy, for Jehovah our God is holy. We may not sully ourselves by unclean practices, however insignificant they may seem to be, but must keep strict watch that how we walk is as wise persons.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:15</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">For us to be keeping our friendship with God we must also be careful as to our dealings with others, especially as regards those in the Christian congregation. We want to go beyond mere justice, not only not doing anything bad to a companion, but lovingly refusing to take up a reproach against an intimate acquaintance who may try us at times. Love covers a multitude of sins.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:8</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Speaking the truth in our hearts is also required of us if we would keep our friendship with Jehovah, keep dwelling in his tent. And what does that include? It means that we must be honest with ourselves and others, and in particular that we cherish the truth of God’s Word, what it tells us about our incomparable God Jehovah, his attributes, works and purposes. We should delight to meditate or think about these things. If these things are truly in our hearts they will also be upon our lips, for out of the heart’s abundance the mouth speaks. By following such a course we will be able to exclaim with the psalmist David: “I will be a guest in your tent for times indefinite,” keeping our friendship with God forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 61:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Make Friends for Yourselves</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> How, then, do we use riches or material goods to make friends with God? Not to bribe God but to <em>glorify</em> God! God owns the whole world, and “the silver is mine, and the gold is mine,” says Jehovah. “To me belongs every wild animal of the forest, the beasts upon a thousand mountains.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Hag. 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Ps. 50:10</a>) So we could not enrich God materially, but we can use our resources to glorify God, by telling others of his purposes, by giving him exclusive devotion and loyal love. When we encourage other persons to study the Bible, when we bring to them Bible-study aids, when we talk with them and help <span id="page110" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>them understand God’s purposes and promise of a righteous new world—we are using our resources to glorify God.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">20.

This matter of making friends with God and his Son is urgent because this world is now in its “time of the end,” and will soon pass away at God’s war of Armageddon. Now is the time to show that we are friendly toward God. Now is the time to get all the help we can in winning God’s friendship. That is why we need to associate regularly with those who love and obey God, those whom Jesus Christ called “my friends.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Luke 12:4</a>) By associating with the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, thousands of persons are learning the course to take to make friends for themselves ‘by means of the unrighteous riches, so that, when such fail, they may receive them into the everlasting dwelling places.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Luke 16:9</a>.</p>

<strong>Proving Ourselves God’s Friends</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> God holds us back from presumptuous acts by means of his Word and by means of prayer. We can study God’s written Word, the Holy Bible, and learn the principles by which Jehovah wants us to walk. We must consult his Book of wisdom. Prayer holds us back from presumptuous acts, for by means of it we can take notice of Jehovah in whatever we do. God holds <span id="page115" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>us back from presumptuous acts, too, by counsel from his organization. When a dispute arose over the matter of circumcision for Gentiles, Paul and Barnabas did not push ahead presumptuously. Paul knew what was the right decision in the matter, but he did not push it! He went to Jerusalem, and there a counsel of apostles and older men examined the matter. A decision was reached, one having the approval of the holy spirit. An organizational letter was prepared and this authoritative pronouncement could be read to the congregation. Paul proceeded only after getting organizational authority. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 15:1-31</a>) So the Christian today is held back from presumptuous acts not only by prayer and by God’s Word but also by counsel from God’s organization. When in doubt as to which way to go at a crucial moment in life, let there be no going ahead solely by human wisdom; refrain from such action, awaiting clarification from Jehovah God by studying his Word. Then we will advance in straight paths and be constant in walking faultlessly.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>PRACTICING RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SPEAKING THE TRUTH</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17.

To practice righteousness one cannot deal dishonestly with his friends or defraud them, nor can he slander them with his tongue. “For you are not a God taking delight in wickedness; no one bad may reside for any time with you. No boasters may take their stand in front of your eyes. You do hate all those practicing what is hurtful; you will destroy those speaking a lie. A man of bloodshed and deception Jehovah detests.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 5:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">18.

Note the description of God’s friend: “To his companion he has done nothing bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 15:3</a>) This includes little things as well as big, for “the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a>) The Christian who borrows from his companion and refuses to repay, for example, is not excused by God because the amount or item involved may not be large. “The wicked one is borrowing and does not pay back.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 37:21</a>) It seems difficult for many persons to repay what they borrow; but if they are truly “practicing righteousness” they will seek to repay what they borrow, even though they cannot repay all at once and even though the time lapse may be considerable. Making the effort to repay shows that one is “practicing righteousness” in his heart.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">19.

The truths that God requires Christians to speak are found in <span id="page116" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="116" data-before-text="116"></span>his Word and they include the commandments of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, especially those concerning the preaching of God’s kingdom.

<strong>Reproach</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those seeking God’s approval cannot be defaming others.

<strong>Who Can Be God’s Friend?</strong><br/>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>“He has not slandered with his tongue”</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To meet this requirement for God’s guests, we must never speak maliciously about others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 15:3</a>) The Hebrew verb rendered “slandered” is derived from the word for “foot” and means “to foot it” and thus “to go about.” The Israelites were commanded: “You must not go around among your people for the sake of slandering. You must not stand up against your fellow’s blood. I am Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 5:13</a>) If we slander someone, robbing him of his good name, we cannot be God’s friends.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">David declared: “Anyone slandering his companion in secrecy, him I silence.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 101:5</a>) We too can silence slanderers if we refuse to listen to them. And a good rule is to say nothing about a person behind his back that we would not be willing to say to his face. It is fine if we have our tongue under such control. Yet, how important it is to control our actions too!</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>“To his companion he has done nothing bad”</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Noteworthy here are Jesus’ words: “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>) To enjoy God’s favor, we must refrain from doing what is bad. The psalmist said: “O you lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad. He is guarding the souls of his loyal ones; out of the hand of the wicked ones he delivers them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>) So if we want God’s friendship and help, we must accept his standards.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Shunning what is bad includes not wronging anybody in business dealings or in other ways. In word and deed, we must do nothing to harm our companion, but we should be doing good things for him. This can touch every aspect of life. For instance, when driving, we may courteously yield the right-of-way to pedestrians. We can help the elderly, encourage the despondent, comfort the grieving. In this regard, Jehovah sets the prime example. As Jesus said, God “makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 5:43-48</a>) Akin to doing good to others is complying with what the psalmist next mentions.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>“And no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance”</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">All of us make mistakes, and how grateful we are when friends choose to overlook these minor errors! We would be distressed if an intimate friend revealed our minor but embarrassing weaknesses to others. Some people do this to divert attention from their own faults or to make themselves appear superior to others. But such acts do not befit those desiring to be God’s friends.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">“The one covering over transgression is seeking love, and he that keeps talking about a matter is separating those familiar <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>with one another,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:9</a>. Of course, we should not try to conceal serious wrongdoing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Leviticus 5:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Proverbs 28:13</a>) But if we want to be God’s friends, we will not ‘take up,’ or receive as true, reproachful stories about upright acquaintances. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:19</a>) Jehovah’s friends speak well of God’s servants instead of spreading tales about them, adding to what they already bear from evil reproaches by ungodly men. God’s friends and guests also guard their associations, for David adds in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 15 verse 4</a>:</p>

But there is one kind of giving that it does not encourage. And what is that? The giving away of a fault of one’s brother, companion or intimate acquaintance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 50:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 20:35</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You may be very careful not to spread false reports, and the idea of indulging in malicious slander or perjuring yourself by bearing false witness may seem abhorrent to you, and that is fine. But did you know that in connection with use of the tongue God requires even more as evidence of neighbor love?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 20:16</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Concerning this we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-3</a>: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain? He who . . . has not slandered with his tongue. To his companion he has done nothing bad, and no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance.” Yes, if you would have God’s friendship you may take up no reproach, whether true or not, against an intimate acquaintance.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">That God views the matter of indulging in harmful talk seriously can be seen from another psalm: “But to the wicked one God will have to say: ‘What right do you have to enumerate my regulations, and that you may bear my covenant in your mouth? Why, you—you have hated discipline, and you keep throwing my words behind you. You sit and speak against your own brother, against the son of your mother you give away a fault.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 50:16, 17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Obviously, when the wicked one gives away a fault it is done in malice or ill will. More often than not, however, the ones giving away a fault are not enemies but those who profess to love one another. Husbands and wives often give away each other’s faults, letting outsiders know about things that should remain hidden. Then again, parents comment to others on the shortcomings of their children, at times even doing so in the presence of their children, to their hurt. Nor is this giving away of a fault unknown or absent from members of Christian congregations.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Not without good reason does God condemn such giving away of a fault. For one thing, it involves the betrayal of a trust, a confidence, for what is particularly condemned is the giving away of a fault of a brother, the taking up of a reproach <span id="page484" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="484" data-before-text="484"></span>against an <em>intimate acquaintance.</em> By reason of close association in the family, at one’s place of employment or of worship one gets to know others intimately, and so has opportunity to observe their shortcomings. Loyalty requires that the reproach be not spread. However, the first man Adam betrayed a glaring lack of loyalty to his wife when he volunteered the information that she had been the first to transgress, and his doing so was not motivated by any prior loyalty to God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 3:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>

<strong>Proving Ourselves God’s Friends</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> God holds us back from presumptuous acts by means of his Word and by means of prayer. We can study God’s written Word, the Holy Bible, and learn the principles by which Jehovah wants us to walk. We must consult his Book of wisdom. Prayer holds us back from presumptuous acts, for by means of it we can take notice of Jehovah in whatever we do. God holds <span id="page115" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>us back from presumptuous acts, too, by counsel from his organization. When a dispute arose over the matter of circumcision for Gentiles, Paul and Barnabas did not push ahead presumptuously. Paul knew what was the right decision in the matter, but he did not push it! He went to Jerusalem, and there a counsel of apostles and older men examined the matter. A decision was reached, one having the approval of the holy spirit. An organizational letter was prepared and this authoritative pronouncement could be read to the congregation. Paul proceeded only after getting organizational authority. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 15:1-31</a>) So the Christian today is held back from presumptuous acts not only by prayer and by God’s Word but also by counsel from God’s organization. When in doubt as to which way to go at a crucial moment in life, let there be no going ahead solely by human wisdom; refrain from such action, awaiting clarification from Jehovah God by studying his Word. Then we will advance in straight paths and be constant in walking faultlessly.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>PRACTICING RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SPEAKING THE TRUTH</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17.

To practice righteousness one cannot deal dishonestly with his friends or defraud them, nor can he slander them with his tongue. “For you are not a God taking delight in wickedness; no one bad may reside for any time with you. No boasters may take their stand in front of your eyes. You do hate all those practicing what is hurtful; you will destroy those speaking a lie.

<strong>Choose Your Friends Wisely</strong><br/><h1 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>Choose Your Friends Wisely</strong></h1><p id="p3" data-pid="3">Close friends add to our happiness during good times, and they strengthen us during hard times. But the Bible warns us that not everyone is a good friend. So how can you choose good friends? Consider the following questions.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. How will the friends you choose affect you?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">We tend to become like the people we spend time with. This can be good or bad​—and that is true whether we spend time with them in person or on social media. As the Bible says, <strong>“the one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid [those who do not love Jehovah] will fare badly.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>) Friends who love and worship Jehovah can help you to stay close to him and to make good decisions. But close friends outside the congregation can cause us to draw away from Jehovah. No wonder the Bible encourages us to choose our friends wisely! When our friends are people who love God, we benefit both ourselves and them. We are able to “keep encouraging one another and building one another up.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2. How will your choice of friends affect Jehovah?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">Jehovah chooses his friends carefully. <strong>“His close friendship is with the upright.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:32</a>) How would Jehovah feel if we were to choose friends who do not love him? He would be very disappointed! (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 4:4</a>.) On the other hand, Jehovah will be pleased and will choose us as friends if we reject bad association and draw close to him and to those who love him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-4</a>.</p><h2 class="du-color--coolGray-400 du-fontSize--basePlus1 du-letterSpacing--8 du-constrainStylesToTextWidth du-borderStyle-top--solid du-borderColor-top--coolGray-400 du-borderWidth-top--4 du-margin-top--12 du-padding-top--4" id="p8" data-pid="8"><span id="page202" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="202" data-before-text="202"></span><strong>DIG DEEPER</strong></h2><p id="p9" data-pid="9">Examine why our choice of friends is so important, and see how you can develop friendships that will truly enrich your life.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-margin-top--0" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>3.

<strong>Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Integrity requires uncompromising loyalty to God and adherence to righteousness, not merely under favorable conditions or circumstances, but under all conditions and at all times. After stressing that only the integrity-keeper, “speaking the truth in his heart,” is acceptable to Jehovah, the psalmist says of such a one that “he has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter,” that is, even if something he has solemnly agreed to turns out to be apparently against his personal interests, he still stays true to his agreement.

<strong>What Will Your Business Cost You?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Stick to Your Word</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">What if business takes a turn for the worse? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995326/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 15:4</a> commends a person who sticks to his agreements even if doing so is not to his advantage: “He has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.” It is easy to stick to one’s word when things are going well. But it becomes a test of integrity when it is to one’s disadvantage financially.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Recall a Biblical example from the time of Joshua. The Gibeonites maneuvered matters so that the chieftains of Israel would covenant with them and not destroy them. Actually, they were part of a nation that was considered a threat to Israel. When the ruse was uncovered, “the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the chieftains of the assembly had sworn to them by Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995326/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 9:18</a>) Even though this group came from enemy territory, the chieftains felt it important to keep their word.

<strong>Who Can Be God’s Friend?</strong><br/>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>“In his eyes anyone contemptible is certainly rejected”</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Seeking selfish benefits, some people keep company with rich or prominent persons even if they are corrupt. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jude 16</a>.) But we cannot be Jehovah’s friends if we associate with the wicked. We should hate evil so much that we do not want to have fellowship with those who practice it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Romans 12:9</a>) So bad was Israel’s king Jehoram that the prophet Elisha told him: “As Jehovah of armies before whom I do stand is living, if it were not that it is the face of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah for which I am having consideration, I would not look at you or see you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Kings 3:14</a>) To be God’s friends, we must heed Paul’s warning: “Bad associations spoil useful habits.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">If we value Jehovah’s friendship, then, we will refuse to associate with wrongdoers. We will do only necessary business with them. Our friends will be chosen for their good relationship with God, not for their standing in the world. We will choose friends wisely if we have a reverential fear of God. In this regard, note the seventh requirement to be met by Jehovah’s guests.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>“But those fearing Jehovah he honors”</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">To be God’s friends and guests, we must fear him. Says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:7</a>: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge.” What is “the fear of Jehovah”? It is reverential awe for God and a wholesome dread of displeasing him. This results in true knowledge, lifesaving discipline, and heavenly wisdom that is a sure guide.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Those fearing Jehovah adhere to his righteous standards even if this results in ridicule. For instance, many scoff when those fearing God work industriously, are honest on the job, or seek to help others spiritually. But how does a godly individual look upon such upright persons? ‘He honors those fearing Jehovah,’ holding them in high esteem, even if this means bearing reproach along with them. Do you have such respect for those fearing God? Citing another requirement for divine favor, the psalmist adds:</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sn"><strong>“He has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter”</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The principle here is that of fulfilling our promises, as God does. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:56;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 1:20</a>) Even if we later find that doing what we promised is very difficult, we should not change our mind and renege on our promise. Here the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> Syriac <em>Peshitta,</em> and Latin <em>Vulgate</em> texts say, “sworn to his neighbor.” If we swear to do something or make a proper vow, we should live up to it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:4</a>) Of <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>course, if we learn that something we promised is unscriptural, we should not do it.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Joshua did not break a covenant with the Gibeonites even though he later learned that they had deceived him into making it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Joshua 9:16-19</a>) So we should be men, women, and young persons who keep our word. Let us not make promises to others and then leave them in the lurch when more appealing opportunities open up to us. Jesus said: “Just let your word <em>Yes</em> mean Yes, your <em>No,</em> No.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 5:37</a>) Especially should those dedicated to Jehovah be determined to live up to their promise to serve him eternally as his Witnesses. Besides keeping promises, we should be considerate in financial matters, as David shows in the 15th Psalm, verse 5 <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps 15:5</a> .</p>

<strong>Maintaining Christian Unity in Business Relationships</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> In formulating written agreements, the parties should give thought not only to objectives but also to possible consequences, such as how to terminate the arrangement in the event that this becomes necessary. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986844/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:5</a>) All business ventures hold an element of risk, and no document can incorporate every circumstance that may arise. If circumstances do change, the agreement may have to be amended or renegotiated. In time it may even become apparent to a person that he has undertaken a business commitment unwisely and he may have to extricate himself in an honorable way. However, this should not be merely a device to escape responsibility for debts incurred by personal extravagance or mismanagement. The matter needs to be discussed to see if the agreement can be dissolved and what financial settlement, if any, needs to be made. Surely, though, a conscientious person will do all he reasonably can to honor contractual obligations, even if he must change his life-style for a time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986844/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 3:12</a>) If a Christian wants to walk faultlessly and practice righteousness, he will try to fulfill his obligations in an agreement even though such is not in his best interests, but he will do this in order to keep Jehovah’s approval. “He has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986844/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-4</a>) In all such proceedings, Jehovah’s servants need to let their “affairs take place with love.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986844/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 16:14</a>.</p>

<strong>Do You Keep Your Word?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">One may say, “But I didn’t know what I was getting into!” The real question here is: Whose fault was it? Was there fraud or deception on the other person’s side? If not, then if you do not back out but endure whatever hardness fulfilling your word requires, you learn a valuable lesson, one you will remember. That is: <em>Think before you talk, before you give your word</em>. Then, when you speak, <em>mean what you say.</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 10:19</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">To say “yes” to something simply because you think it will please someone​—but without first thinking out the consequences—​can get you into difficulty. By contrast, if you are careful about making promises, if you think matters through and consider how they will affect your future life, then it will be much easier to keep your word once you have committed yourself. You will have prepared your heart and mind to be true to your word.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Naturally, you cannot foresee everything. Circumstances may change between the time of giving your word and the time of carrying it out, or even during the period of carrying it out. But if the other person has not proved false to his or her part, why should you prove false?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Showing God’s view on this, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 15</a> raises the question as to what kind of person God accepts as his “guest” and then answers, saying: “He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness, and speaking the truth in his heart. . . . He has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 15:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">It is not surprising that God counts as his friends only those who keep their word. Why so? Because he himself does this unfailingly. That is why Joshua could say to the nation of Israel: “You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972003/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>) The Bible is largely a record of Jehovah’s kept promises. His trueness in the past is what gives us such confidence of future blessings in fulfillment of his promises.</p>

<strong>The Refining Power of Adversity</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This more honorable course is the one that the psalmist of old, King David, recommended <span id="page420" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="420" data-before-text="420"></span>when he spoke favorably about the one that “has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.” Or as worded by a modern free translation, David commended him “who stands by his pledge at any cost.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967520/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 15:4</a>, <em>The Jerusalem Bible.</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Another example that might be given of the refining power of adversity endured because of principle and in the right frame of mind is that which at times comes to parents with the discovery that a child of theirs is what used to be called “mentally retarded,” but now is more considerately and accurately described as a “slow learner.” What shall they do? Become bitter and resentful? Or lightly shift their burden to a state institution and forget all about the child, as some parents have done? No, there is a better way.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">True, keeping such a child at home may place quite a burden upon the rest of the family, but what possibilities the bearing of this burden holds out in the way of refining them by training them to exercise patience, sympathy, understanding and empathy; in brief, unselfishness! As one of America’s leading writers​—whose autobiographical book has proved a great comfort to ever so many parents with slow-learning children—​expressed it: “My helpless child has taught me so much. She has taught me patience, above all else.” In fact, latest medical opinion holds that if it is at all practicable, it is the best for all concerned, for society, for the parents and for the child itself, to keep it at home.​—<em>The Child Who Never Grew,</em> Pearl Buck (1950).</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Then, again, the refining power of adversity can be experienced by ‘standing by one’s pledge, one’s marriage vows, at any cost,’ in spite of keen disillusionment and disappointment. Unhappy results often follow when persons lacking in understanding marry, as in the case of teen-agers. Many seek the easy way out, by means of separation or divorce; and this is the course that many teen-agers in the United States are taking, with divorces being from three to four times as high among teen-age married persons as among older persons.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">However, there are great possibilities for the refining of the personalities of each by each resolving to endure the period of adjustment needed; by learning to exercise self-control under provocation, learning to express unselfish interest in the other, thereby progressing to the emotional maturity each should have had before getting married in the first place. After all, did they not marry “for better or for worse,” and does it not largely depend upon themselves as to just how much joy or pain each gets from the relationship? Those who want to make a success of it can find much helpful counsel in the Word of God, the Bible.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967520/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967520/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:22-33</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Of course, all of this has the most pertinent application to Christians who have dedicated themselves to God, for the doing of his will, and to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. In carrying out their dedication they may well find hardships in the form of discipline and adversity that they had not foreseen. But by enduring they will be refined, even as indicated by the inspired words: “No discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.” And, additionally, Christians have the promise of receiving everlasting life by enduring to the end.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967520/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 12:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967520/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:13</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Wisely the Psalms show us the need to concern ourselves with the law of God, with the other parts of God’s Word as well: “Happy is the man” whose “delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” “I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” “How I do love your law! <span id="page552" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="552" data-before-text="552"></span>All day long it is my concern.”—1:1, 2; 77:12; 119:97.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">While such admonition, either direct or indirect, either explicit or implied, is to be expected in the book of the Psalms, what is often overlooked is that it is also filled with wise admonition as to daily conduct. For example, time and again its writers show that they appreciate that “bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>) “I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit.” “In his eyes anyone contemptible is certainly rejected.” “Anyone of haughty eyes and of arrogant heart, him I cannot endure.” “Get away from me, you evildoers, that I may observe the commandments of my God.”—26:5; 15:4; 101:5; 119:115.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The Psalms also throw light on life’s roadway by their wise counsel as to what should be our attitude when we see the wicked prosper: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent. Sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in Jehovah.” “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.”—4:4, 5; 37:1, 9.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Then again, the Psalms enlighten by showing what God approves and what he disapproves: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? . . . He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart. He has not slandered with his tongue. To his companion he has done nothing bad, and no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance. . . . A bribe against the innocent one he has not taken.” (15:1-3, 5) “Safeguard your tongue against what is bad, and your lips against speaking deception. Turn away from what is bad, and do what is good; seek to find peace, and pursue it.” “Lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.”—34:13, 14; 97:10.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">We have further light on our roadway by the very things the psalmist prays for: “Mistakes—who can discern? From concealed sins pronounce me innocent. Also from presumptuous acts hold your servant back; do not let them dominate me. In that case I shall be complete, and I shall have remained innocent from much transgression. Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah.” (19:12-14) “O Jehovah, my heart has not been haughty, nor have my eyes been lofty.” “Do set a guard, O Jehovah, for my mouth; do set a watch over the door of my lips. Should the righteous one strike me, it would be a loving-kindness; and should he reprove me, it would be oil upon the head, which my head would not want to refuse.”—131:1; 141:3, 5.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Truly, today there is need of light, spiritual light for guidance on life’s roadway. Such light certainly is to be found in the book of Psalms, along with other books of the Bible, for the Psalms contain much history, many prophecies, right doctrine and an abundance of fine admonition in addition to its many songs of praise to and expressions of trust in Jehovah God. “Make melody to God, make melody. Make melody to our King, make melody. For God is King of all the earth; make melody, <em>acting with discretion.”</em>—47:6, 7.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"></p>

Yet the Bible commends the person who has “sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101983086/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 15:4</a>) This means being willing to accept the consequences of your bad agreement​—chalking it up to experience.</p>

<strong>Honesty—Is It Really the Best Policy?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“In his eyes anyone contemptible is certainly rejected, but those fearing Jehovah he honors. He has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101982329/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 15 Verse 4</a>) Good association will help you to avoid dishonesty. If you make friends with youths who lie or cheat, they will expect you to do the same things. Often such young people brag about their exploits, comparing notes, and daring one another to ever more brazen acts. While such people may seem clever and glamorous to one another, how do you think God views them?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Did you notice that Jehovah appreciates people who keep their word? That is an important part of honesty. Perhaps you promised to help out around the house this Saturday, but now you have been invited to a ball game for that afternoon. In effect, you have ‘sworn to what seems to be bad for yourself.’ Now, what are you going to do? Will you treat your word lightly, leaving your parents to do your chores while you go to the game, or will you keep your word?</p>

<strong>Does Your “Yes” Really Mean Yes?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Of course, it is not always easy to keep one’s word. Sometimes changed circumstances prevent this. Nevertheless, the Scriptures say that a practicer of righteousness having Jehovah God’s favor “has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101978121/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101978121/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Yes, he may have solemnly agreed to something that turned out to be apparently against his personal interests. But he remained true to his agreement.</p>

<strong>Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Job, who evidently lived in the period between the death of Joseph and the time of Moses (see JOB), is described as a man who had “proved to be blameless [Heb., <em>tam</em>] and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:1</a>) That human integrity <span id="page837" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="837" data-before-text="837"></span>forms part of the issue between Jehovah God and Satan is clear from God’s questioning his adversary about Job when Satan appeared during an angelic assembly in the courts of heaven. Satan imputed false motive to Job’s worship of God, alleging that Job served not out of pure devotion but for selfish benefits. He thereby placed in question Job’s integrity to God. Permitted to divest Job of his vast possessions and even of his children, Satan failed to crack Job’s integrity. (1:6–2:3) He then claimed that Job was selfishly willing to endure the loss of possessions and children as long as he could save his own skin. (2:4, 5) Thereafter stricken with a painful, consuming disease, subjected to dissuasion from his own wife and to disparaging criticism and slurs from companions who misrepresented God’s standards and purposes (2:6-13; 22:1, 5-11), Job’s response was: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself! On my justness I have laid hold, and I shall not let it go; my heart will not taunt me for any of my days.” (27:5, 6) His maintaining integrity demonstrated that God’s adversary was a liar.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Satan’s challenging statements in Job’s case show he held the position that all persons could be drawn away from God’s side, that none served out of a purely unselfish motive. Thus humans, as well as God’s spirit sons, have the remarkable privilege of contributing to the vindication and sanctification of God’s name and demonstrating their support of Jehovah’s sovereignty, doing so by a course of integrity. The ones “blameless in their way are a pleasure” to Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 11:20</a>; contrast this with the false view advanced by Eliphaz at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 22:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong><em>Basis for divine judgment</em></strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">God’s favorable judgment is dependent on the creature’s integrity-keeping course.

Please, may the badness of wicked ones come to an end, and may you establish the righteous one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 7:8, 9</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>.)

Rather, the Scriptures show it means wholeness of completeness of heart devotion. David, through weakness, committed several serious wrongs, but he, nevertheless, ‘walked with integrity of heart’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:4</a>), for he accepted reproof and corrected his way. He thereby proved that his heart still retained genuine love for Jehovah God.

After stressing that only the integrity-keeper, “speaking the truth in his heart,” is acceptable to Jehovah, the psalmist says of such a one that “he has sworn to what is bad for himself, and yet he does not alter,” that is, even if something he has solemnly agreed to turns out to be apparently against his personal interests, he still stays true to his agreement. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1-5</a>; contrast <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Romans 1:31,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012131/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 1:10</a>.)

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/458/0">9/15/1989, pp. 29-30</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Who Can Be God’s Friend?</strong><br/>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn"><strong>“His money he has not given out on interest”</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Money lent for business purposes can rightly be repaid with interest. But here David meant ‘giving out money’ to the destitute. The Mosaic Law specified: “If you should lend money to my people, to the afflicted alongside you, you must not become like a usurer to him. You must not lay interest upon him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Exodus 22:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Leviticus 25:35, 36</a>) When Nehemiah found the poor suffering as victims of usurers, he stopped such exploitation.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Nehemiah 5:1-13</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">For “interest,” David used a Hebrew word derived from another one signifying “to bite.” This suggests that greedy usurers were devouring the poor and the little that they had. Clearly, it is much better to help the poverty-stricken without expecting any return. Jesus made such a point by saying: “When you spread a dinner or evening meal, . . . invite poor people, crippled, lame, blind; and you will be happy, because they have nothing with which to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Luke 14:12-14</a>) A person desiring to be God’s friend and guest would never take undue advantage of his neighbor’s poverty and would comply with what the psalmist goes on to mention.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sn"><strong>“And a bribe against the innocent one he has not taken”</strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">A bribe has a corrupting influence. The Israelites were commanded: “You must not . . . accept a bribe, for the bribe blinds the eyes of wise ones and distorts the words of righteous ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>) It is especially evil to take a bribe to do injury to an “innocent one,” perhaps by changing court testimony. How despicable Judas Iscariot was in accepting a bribe to betray innocent Jesus!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 26:14-16</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">We may consider ourselves faultless in this regard. But have we ever been tempted to buy our way out of an embarrassing situation? The prophet Samuel never accepted “hush money,” or a bribe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Samuel 12:3, 4</a>) All of us must conduct ourselves in that way if we are to be God’s friends and guests.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sn"><strong>“He that is doing these things will never be made to totter”</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">After its tenfold description of an upright person, the 15th Psalm concludes with the foregoing words. They may well make us analyze our religion. If it is the true faith, it should teach us to (1) walk faultlessly and practice righteousness, (2) speak the truth even in the heart, (3) avoid slandering others, and (4) refrain from doing anything bad. Religion acceptable to God will (5) keep us from taking up reproaches against upright acquaintances and will (6) make us avoid association with contemptible persons. The true faith will move us to (7) honor those fearing Jehovah, (8) carry out what we have promised to do if it is proper, (9) give to the impoverished without charging interest, and (10) never take a bribe against an innocent person.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>David does not say that anyone reading, hearing, speaking, or even believing these things “will never be made to totter.” This will be the experience only of the individual “that is <em>doing</em> these things.” Faith without works to back it up is dead and does not result in divine approval. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">James 2:26</a>) Doers of the good things mentioned in the 15th Psalm will not totter, for Jehovah will protect and uphold them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989686/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>.</p>

<strong>Honesty—Is It Really the Best Policy?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">“His money he has not given out on interest, and a bribe against the innocent one he has not taken. He that is doing these things will never be made to totter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101982329/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 15 Verse 5</a>) Isn’t it true that greed is a major cause of cheating and dishonesty? Students who cheat on tests are greedy for grades that they have not studied hard enough to deserve. People who dishonestly take bribes value money ahead of justice. God doesn’t want such people for his friends!</p>

But how solid is the success of such persons? Answers <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101989355/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 37:2</a>: “Like grass they will speedily wither, and like <span id="page217" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="217" data-before-text="217"></span>green new grass they will fade away.” If not caught and disgraced by others, ultimately they face the judgment of Jehovah God. God’s friends, however, “will <em>never</em> be made to totter.” Their eternal future is assured.</p>
