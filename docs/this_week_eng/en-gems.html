<strong>Light</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Scriptures contain many figurative references to light. Ability to see is meant by the words “the light of my own eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ps. 38:10</a>) For God to “give light” to someone means that he gives them life or allows them to continue living. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Job 3:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 23</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 56:13</a>.) “Children that have seen no light” are those who are born dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Job 3:16</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 49:19</a>.) “It is good for the eyes to see the sun” may be understood to mean ‘it is good to be alive.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:7</a>. <span id="page1068" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1068" data-before-text="1068"></span>Morning light is picturesquely described as ‘taking hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it,’ because dawn disperses evildoers. Darkness is their “light,” for they are accustomed to carry out their evil deeds under its cover and this figurative “light” is taken from them by the literal light of dawn.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 38:12-15</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 24:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As the light of the sun is clearly observable, thus Jehovah’s adverse judgments are obvious. This is alluded to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Hosea 6:5</a>: “The judgments upon you will be as the light that goes forth.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The ‘light of God’s face’ means divine favor. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 44:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 89:15</a>) “Lift up the light of your face upon us” is an expression meaning ‘show us favor.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ps. 4:6</a>) Similarly, the favor of a ruler is referred to as “the light of the king’s face.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Prov. 16:15</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Light may denote brightness or cheerfulness, the opposite of gloom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Job 30:26</a>) This may explain the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Job (29:24</a>): “The light of my face they would not cast down.” Although others were gloomy and dejected, this did not cause Job to become of like disposition.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">A bright prospect, such as salvation or deliverance, is at times referred to under the figure of light. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Esther 8:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/1" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Ps. 97:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/2" data-bid="63-3" class="b"> Isa. 30:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/3" data-bid="63-4" class="b"> Mic. 7:8, 9</a>) Jehovah’s causing his glory to shine forth upon Zion pointed forward to her deliverance from a captive state. As a result Zion was to become a source of enlightenment to the nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Isa. 60:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/63/1" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Revelation 21:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/64/1" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> 22:5</a>.)

<strong>Copyist</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The psalmist, his heart “astir with a goodly matter” concerning God’s Messianic King, said: “May my tongue be the stylus of a skilled copyist.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001032/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 45:1-5</a>) His wish was that his tongue prove to be eloquent, a match for the exalted theme of his composition, which was inspired of God. Thus, the psalmist desired that his tongue function efficiently, like a stylus in the hand of a trained and skillful copyist, one with ability.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>3, 4.</strong><strong> (a) What is “something good” that concerns us, and how can it affect our heart?

The Hebrew verb translated “is stirred” originally meant “to bubble up,” or “boil.” This matter made the psalmist’s heart boil over with enthusiasm and made his tongue become like “the stylus of a skilled copyist.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> What about us? The good news of the Messianic Kingdom is something good that touches our heart. The Kingdom message became especially “good” in 1914. Since then, the message no longer concerns a future Kingdom but has to do with a real government now functioning in the heavens. This is the “good news of the Kingdom” that we preach “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014122/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Is our heart “stirred” by the Kingdom message? Do we preach the good news of the Kingdom with zeal? Like the psalmist, our “song is about a king”​—our King Jesus Christ. We proclaim him as the enthroned heavenly King of the Messianic Kingdom. Moreover, we invite all​—the rulers and the ruled—​to submit to his kingship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014122/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 2:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014122/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4-12</a>) And our tongue becomes like “the stylus of a skilled copyist” in that we make extensive use of the written Word in our preaching work.</p>

Anticipation of the coming of a good government in the hands of an incorruptible, righteous ruler was too strong. He could not keep silent. No longer able to contain himself, the psalmist burst forth with these words: “My heart has become astir with a goodly matter. I am saying: ‘My works are concerning a king.’ May my tongue be the stylus of a skilled copyist.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987165/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 45:1</a>) The original poet-singer is long dead.

It is related to the good news of God’s Kingdom! So “goodly” is the Kingdom message that it deserves to “be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations” before “the end” of these nations comes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987165/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) Today, has the “goodly” theme of God’s Messianic Kingdom stirred your heart? It should. Why? Because the Hebrew verb translated “has become astir” (<em>ra·chashʹ</em>) signifies excited motion, like a bubbling, boiling liquid. The verb also connotes fullness. And remember, our Leader, Jesus Christ, said: “Out of the heart’s abundance [the] mouth speaks.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987165/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 6:45</a>) Thus, do you, like the psalmist, have a heart overflowing with the “goodly matter”?

By means of holy spirit, the psalmist’s tongue became a “stylus” in the hands of Jehovah. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987165/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:2</a>.) His penned lyrics were sung for all of Jehovah’s ancient worshipers to hear. We today can champion the truth of God’s Kingdom in two similar ways. First, by our words heard in public preaching and, second, by our words read in our literature. Hence, when we distribute Bible-based literature, we are telling what the tongue of inspired holy men has already said. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987165/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987165/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 1:20, 21</a>) And today the printed Kingdom message is circulated in numbers and languages and at a speed beyond the imagination of the psalmist. Are you having a regular part in its dissemination, especially by the distribution of the <em>Watchtower</em> and <em>Awake!</em> journals?</p>

The apostle Paul wrote: “When he [Jesus] came as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, yes, death on a torture stake. For this very reason, God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend​—of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground—​and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014122/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 2:8-11</a>) Jehovah blessed Jesus “forever” by resurrecting him to immortal life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 6:9</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002603/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 4:22</a>) No doubt his enthusiasm animated his features, and his eyes shone with a lively interest in his subject.

Because of Jesus’ loyalty, Jehovah then blessed him forever by resurrecting him from the dead and exalting him above all other creatures. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987165/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Philippians 2:8-11</a>) Since Jesus’ heavenly glorification, when he became ‘the exact representation of God’s very being,’ he is more beauteous than the most exalted ruler, human or angelic.

The reason why is that he spoke what God taught him to speak. He preached and taught God’s truth about the theocratic government that is to bless all mankind. When Jesus Christ was standing trial for his life and the Roman governor Pontius Pilate asked him whether he was a king, he fearlessly answered: “You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone that is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979044/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) For his faithfully telling the truth about the Kingdom, God blessed him with a resurrection from the dead. Moreover, God gave him a heavenly kingship, not only over the Israelite subjects of King David, but also over all mankind. God’s indefinitely lasting blessing upon him portends good for all of us.</p>

The Lord Jesus forms not only the basis, supplying everything fundamental as the very beginner, author and leader of our faith, but he is also the perfecter, the crowning beauty, the “altogether lovely” one, the grand and all-glorious King of Zion, and Jehovah’s glory rests upon him. “Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.” “Jesus Christ, ‘the Faithful Witness,’ ‘The firstborn from the dead,’ and ‘The Ruler of the kings of the earth’.

And why not? Had not Israel been in captivity for seventy years? Were they not now back in their own land and their temple rebuilt amid tremendous opposition? Now as the finishing touches were put to it, no wonder they gave out “with thundering shouts”!</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">16.

Besides girding upon him this executioner’s authority pictured by the sword, he girds upon himself dignity and splendor, going forth in the glorious role of Jehovah’s King and Vindicator. God’s Warrior-King rides to the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” in the cause of truth, to establish the truth of all of God’s written Word. He rides his symbolic war mount to Armageddon to vindicate Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and sanctify the divine name—the greatest act of righteousness. He rides on to victory also in the cause of establishing righteousness in all the universe. The book of Revelation pictures the King riding a white horse and having a bow with which to shoot arrows at all his enemies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 6:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19:11-16</a>) This skilled Archer does not miss his targets, so as to kill off righteous persons; but he speeds his arrows of destruction to the heart of all those who oppose God’s righteous new world. No enemies of righteousness will survive the King’s victorious ride that ensures the triumphant entry of a righteous new world.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>RIGHTEOUS RULER AND GOVERNMENT</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">After describing the King’s Armageddon ride in the cause of righteousness, the inspired psalmist gives us assurance that the government of the new world will never be corrupted, since it is written concerning its Ruler: “God is your throne to time indefinite, even forever; the scepter of your kingship is a scepter of uprightness. You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness. That is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 45:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Jesus Christ was anointed with the “oil of exultation” when he was installed in his heavenly throne as King A.D. 1914, in fulfillment of Bible prophecies, as this journal has often explained. That was a time of exultation for Jesus Christ, a most refreshing experience after he had waited for nineteen centuries at God’s right hand. Having been ushered into the joy of being Jehovah’s reigning King over all the universe, he will never abuse his power. The scepter of his kingship is one of uprightness, one in which there will never be the least bit of crookedness. Jesus proved his love for righteousness and his hatred for wickedness when he was on the earth, proving it even down to death in faithfulness to God. But now he has been raised from the dead and placed in a responsible position where he can fight for righteousness and enforce it with all the needed power in heaven and on earth. Moreover, he does not change, since “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In view of this assurance from God, let all persons who have longed for a righteous government look to Jehovah’s King, rejoicing in the knowledge that he will never turn to crookedness and oppression. The kingdom of God in the hands of Jesus Christ will be the righteous “new heavens” of that new world, and God’s promise will be fulfilled, just as the apostle Peter declared after he described the uncovering and punishing of all unrighteousness: “But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p>

<strong>The Horsemen of the Apocalypse</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Making the same point are the following scriptures: “Some concerning chariots and others concerning horses, but, as for us, concerning the name of Jehovah our God we shall make mention.” “The horse is a deception for salvation, and by the abundance of its vital energy it does not afford escape.” “Woe to those going down to Egypt for assistance, those who rely on mere horses, and who put their trust in war chariots, because they are numerous, and in steeds, because they are very mighty, but who have not looked to the Holy One of Israel and have not searched <span id="page151" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="151" data-before-text="151"></span>for Jehovah himself.

Who is he? Jesus Christ. He is the one that has been given a crown by his Father and is commanded to go forth in a righteous war, pictured by the white horse. This picture calls to mind the words of the psalmist: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, with your dignity and your splendor. And in your splendor go on to success; ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness, and your right hand will instruct you in fear-inspiring things. Your arrows are sharp—under you peoples keep falling.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Even more explicitly identifying the first horseman are John’s own words recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>: “Look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness . . . and the name he is called is The Word of God. Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">When did this rider go forth to conquer? According to fulfilled Bible prophecy, in the year 1914. Then it was that Jehovah said to his Son, “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:2</a>) That marked the time when the dragon and his demons warred against Michael and his angels, right after the birth of God’s kingdom, pictured by the birth of a male child; all of which began to take place in heaven when “the nations became wrathful” on earth in 1914.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 12:1-9</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>THE OTHER HORSEMEN</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The second horseman rode a fiery-colored or red mount. The horseman had a large sword and it was granted to him to take peace from the earth, resulting in a large slaughter among men. Red is associated with war because war means bloodshed and blood is red. Thus the ancients made the planet Mars a symbol of war because of its reddish hue. This horseman’s work finds mention in Jesus’ great prophecy: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” Certainly World War I, beginning in 1914, took peace from the earth and resulted in much slaughter.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The third horse was black and its rider carried a pair of scales. He was accompanied by an announcement of high prices: a quart of wheat and three quarts of barley, each for a denarius, a day’s wages. (Barley was held to be so far inferior to wheat that Roman soldiers at times were punished by being given barley instead of wheat rations.) This horseman pictures famine due to war. Fittingly the horse itself was black, for blackness is a symbol of famine: “Their aspect has become darker than blackness itself. They have not been recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled upon their bones.” Jesus, in his great prophecy, likewise associated world war with famine: “Nation will rise against nation and . . . there will be food shortages.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lam. 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The rider’s having a pair of scales in his hand is also indicative of famine conditions. Thus Ezekiel was told: “Son of man, . . . they will have to eat bread by weight and in anxious care, and it will be by measure and in horror that they will drink water itself, to the intent that they may be lacking bread and water.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to the meaning of the peculiar instruction given to this third horseman, <span id="page152" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="152" data-before-text="152"></span>“Do not harm the olive oil and the wine,” God’s Word itself gives a clue, for at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:17</a> we are told that “he that is loving wine and oil will not gain riches.” Wine and oil are symbols of luxuries and their not being harmed would indicate that, in spite of famine conditions that affected the common people, the rich still had their luxuries, and so it proved to be.</p>

<strong>Hail Christ, the Glorious King!</strong><br/><h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>THE KING RIDES “IN THE CAUSE OF TRUTH”</strong></h2>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong><strong> How does Christ ride “in the cause of truth”?</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> <strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014122/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 45:4</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Warrior-King does not wage a war of conquest in order to occupy territories and subjugate peoples. He wages a righteous war with noble objectives. He rides “in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness.” The greatest truth that must be defended is that of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty. Satan challenged the legitimacy of Jehovah’s rulership when he rebelled against Him. Since then, that fundamental truth has been disputed by both demons and humans. Now the time has come for Jehovah’s anointed King to ride forth to establish the truth of Jehovah’s sovereignty once and for all.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong><strong> In what way does the King ride ‘in the cause of humility’?</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> The King also rides ‘in the cause of humility.’ As God’s only-begotten Son, he himself has provided a sterling example of humility and loyal subjection to his Father’s sovereignty.

Just what means he will use to destroy Satan’s system, we do not know.

Who is he? Jesus Christ. He is the one that has been given a crown by his Father and is commanded to go forth in a righteous war, pictured by the white horse. This picture calls to mind the words of the psalmist: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, with your dignity and your splendor. And in your splendor go on to success; ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness, and your right hand will instruct you in fear-inspiring things. Your arrows are sharp—under you peoples keep falling.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Even more explicitly identifying the first horseman are John’s own words recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>: “Look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness . . . and the name he is called is The Word of God. Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">When did this rider go forth to conquer? According to fulfilled Bible prophecy, in the year 1914. Then it was that Jehovah said to his Son, “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:2</a>) That marked the time when the dragon and his demons warred against Michael and his angels, right after the birth of God’s kingdom, pictured by the birth of a male child; all of which began to take place in heaven when “the nations became wrathful” on earth in 1914.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 12:1-9</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>THE OTHER HORSEMEN</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The second horseman rode a fiery-colored or red mount. The horseman had a large sword and it was granted to him to take peace from the earth, resulting in a large slaughter among men. Red is associated with war because war means bloodshed and blood is red. Thus the ancients made the planet Mars a symbol of war because of its reddish hue. This horseman’s work finds mention in Jesus’ great prophecy: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” Certainly World War I, beginning in 1914, took peace from the earth and resulted in much slaughter.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The third horse was black and its rider carried a pair of scales. He was accompanied by an announcement of high prices: a quart of wheat and three quarts of barley, each for a denarius, a day’s wages. (Barley was held to be so far inferior to wheat that Roman soldiers at times were punished by being given barley instead of wheat rations.) This horseman pictures famine due to war. Fittingly the horse itself was black, for blackness is a symbol of famine: “Their aspect has become darker than blackness itself. They have not been recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled upon their bones.” Jesus, in his great prophecy, likewise associated world war with famine: “Nation will rise against nation and . . . there will be food shortages.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lam. 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The rider’s having a pair of scales in his hand is also indicative of famine conditions. Thus Ezekiel was told: “Son of man, . . . they will have to eat bread by weight and in anxious care, and it will be by measure and in horror that they will drink water itself, to the intent that they may be lacking bread and water.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to the meaning of the peculiar instruction given to this third horseman, <span id="page152" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="152" data-before-text="152"></span>“Do not harm the olive oil and the wine,” God’s Word itself gives a clue, for at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:17</a> we are told that “he that is loving wine and oil will not gain riches.” Wine and oil are symbols of luxuries and their not being harmed would indicate that, in spite of famine conditions that affected the common people, the rich still had their luxuries, and so it proved to be.</p>

Who is he? Jesus Christ. He is the one that has been given a crown by his Father and is commanded to go forth in a righteous war, pictured by the white horse. This picture calls to mind the words of the psalmist: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, with your dignity and your splendor. And in your splendor go on to success; ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness, and your right hand will instruct you in fear-inspiring things. Your arrows are sharp—under you peoples keep falling.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Even more explicitly identifying the first horseman are John’s own words recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>: “Look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness . . . and the name he is called is The Word of God. Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">When did this rider go forth to conquer? According to fulfilled Bible prophecy, in the year 1914. Then it was that Jehovah said to his Son, “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:2</a>) That marked the time when the dragon and his demons warred against Michael and his angels, right after the birth of God’s kingdom, pictured by the birth of a male child; all of which began to take place in heaven when “the nations became wrathful” on earth in 1914.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 12:1-9</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>THE OTHER HORSEMEN</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The second horseman rode a fiery-colored or red mount. The horseman had a large sword and it was granted to him to take peace from the earth, resulting in a large slaughter among men. Red is associated with war because war means bloodshed and blood is red. Thus the ancients made the planet Mars a symbol of war because of its reddish hue. This horseman’s work finds mention in Jesus’ great prophecy: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” Certainly World War I, beginning in 1914, took peace from the earth and resulted in much slaughter.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The third horse was black and its rider carried a pair of scales. He was accompanied by an announcement of high prices: a quart of wheat and three quarts of barley, each for a denarius, a day’s wages. (Barley was held to be so far inferior to wheat that Roman soldiers at times were punished by being given barley instead of wheat rations.) This horseman pictures famine due to war. Fittingly the horse itself was black, for blackness is a symbol of famine: “Their aspect has become darker than blackness itself. They have not been recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled upon their bones.” Jesus, in his great prophecy, likewise associated world war with famine: “Nation will rise against nation and . . . there will be food shortages.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lam. 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The rider’s having a pair of scales in his hand is also indicative of famine conditions. Thus Ezekiel was told: “Son of man, . . . they will have to eat bread by weight and in anxious care, and it will be by measure and in horror that they will drink water itself, to the intent that they may be lacking bread and water.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to the meaning of the peculiar instruction given to this third horseman, <span id="page152" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="152" data-before-text="152"></span>“Do not harm the olive oil and the wine,” God’s Word itself gives a clue, for at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:17</a> we are told that “he that is loving wine and oil will not gain riches.” Wine and oil are symbols of luxuries and their not being harmed would indicate that, in spite of famine conditions that affected the common people, the rich still had their luxuries, and so it proved to be.</p>

<strong>Commander’s Staff</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God himself is identified as saying: “Judah is my commander’s staff.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps 60:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 108:8</a>) While holding the commander’s staff indicates that the possessor would be a leader with the power to command, a scepter in a monarch’s hand signifies his possession of regal sovereignty or prerogative as a royal ruler. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 45:6</a>) Therefore, the use of the terms “scepter” and “commander’s staff” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a> evidently indicates that significant authority and power would reside with the tribe of Judah. But that more than tribal authority and dominance were involved is clear since Shiloh, to whom “the obedience of the peoples will belong,” was to come from the tribe of Judah. That circumstance betokens royal authority and power over the people. When Judah’s descendant David became the king of Israel, the scepter and commander’s staff proved to be in the possession of the tribe of Judah, and these would not depart from it until the coming of Shiloh, the Messiah.

It is scarcely possible that [<em>’Elo·himʹ</em>] in the original can be addressed to the king. The presumption therefore is against the belief that [<em>ho the·osʹ</em>] is a vocative in the LXX. Thus on the whole it seems best to adopt in the first clause the rendering: <em>God is Thy throne</em> (or, <em>Thy throne is God</em>), that is ‘Thy kingdom is founded upon God, the immovable Rock.’”—<em>The Epistle to the Hebrews</em> (London, 1889), pp. 25, 26.</p>

<strong>How the Day of Reckoning Is Worked Out for Our Good</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[23]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The victory at Har–Magedon will vindicate the universal sovereignty of God the Almighty. Because he successfully uses Jesus Christ to gain this victory, God will count him worthy to retain his heavenly throne. As long as God lasts, the throne of his anointed King Jesus Christ will last. This important fact is emphasized by the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979045/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 45:6, 7</a>, which the psalmist addresses to the King, saying: “God is your throne to time indefinite, even forever; the scepter of your kingship is a scepter of uprightness. You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness. That is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.” These words we recognize to be the ones quoted by the apostle Paul to prove Christ’s superiority over the angels. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979045/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 1:7-9</a>) Because he loved righteousness and hated wickedness or lawlessness, Christ’s scepter was bound to be wielded in behalf of uprightness. This betokens good for mankind.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="qu"> 3. Who were the “partners” of Jesus Christ, and why was the “oil of exultation” with which he was anointed more than theirs?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[24]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> As a man on earth, Jesus had kings as forefathers. The psalmist mentions that he would have earthly forefathers. Many of these, from King Jehoiachin back to King David, had been his “partners” in sharing the kingdom set up by God and in sitting on “Jehovah’s throne.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979045/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979045/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 13:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979045/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979045/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Matt. 1:6-12</a>) Those royal forefathers doubtless exulted in their kingship over God’s chosen people. But none of those royal “partners” could feel exultation to the extent that the glorified Jesus Christ feels it. His kingship is far superior to theirs, it being heavenly, yes, superangelic. Jehovah, the God of Jesus Christ, anointed him more abundantly with the “oil of exultation” because of his perfect, incorruptible devotion to God’s righteousness.</p>

<strong>Commander’s Staff</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A long rod serving as a token of power to command. The staff of a commander is a symbol of his right to issue orders. The expression “commander’s staff” appears four times in the <em>New World Translation,</em> translating the <span id="page367" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="367" data-before-text="367"></span>participle <em>m<sup>e</sup>hho·qeqʹ,</em> which is from a Hebrew root meaning to inscribe or engrave and hence, by implication to decree or enact. In ancient times, laws that were enacted were inscribed or engraved on stone or metal tablets. The same Hebrew word can apply to a commander who issues decrees, a “statute-giver.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 33:21</a>) Without peer among legislators is Jehovah, the supreme “Statute-giver.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 33:22</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When a commander was seated, his long staff would often rest upon the ground and lie back against the fold of his robe, between his knees. This fact lends meaning to Jacob’s deathbed blessing of Judah: “The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 49:10</a>) Here the Hebrew word <em>m<sup>e</sup>hho·qeqʹ</em> has been rendered “lawgiver” in some translations (<em>AV; Yg</em>), but its other meaning, “commander’s staff” (<em>NW; Ro</em>), is more appropriate in this case and has the support of modern lexicographers. (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> by Koehler and Baumgartner, 1953, p. 328; <em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> by Brown, Driver and Briggs, p. 349) That an object and not a person is evidently intended at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a> is the understanding conveyed in various translations, which have renderings such as “ruler’s staff” (<em>AS; RS</em>), “staff of sway” (<em>Mo</em>) and “staff” (<em>AT</em>). A staff of some type, a “commander’s staff,” also nicely parallels the “scepter” and goes with the phrase “from between his feet” appearing in the same verse. Similar usage is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Numbers 21:17, 18</a>, where a well is said to be excavated “with a commander’s staff, with their own staffs,” though a possible reading there is, “with a commander, with their rulers.” At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a> an alternate, though not preferable, reading for “neither the commander’s staff” is “neither a commander.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In ancient sculptures certain monarchs have been represented with a long staff or a scepter in hand. For instance, in a relief at his palace in Khorsabad, Assyrian King Sargon II was shown holding a staff. Since a “scepter” is a staff or rod, some might conclude that there is no difference between the “scepter” and the “commander’s staff” of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a>. However, it appears that Jacob intended to make a distinction between them. Parallel terms are often employed in poetic expressions. Though they are similar, upon closer examination one term is seen to convey to the mind a slightly different thought than the other, frequently enhancing one’s understanding of what has been said. Jacob seems to have used such a device in blessing his sons. For example, he stated that Dan would “prove to be a <em>serpent</em> by the roadside, a <em>horned snake</em> at the wayside” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 49:17</a>), using these parallel expressions in a good sense to indicate that Dan would be a peril to the foes of Israel.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God himself is identified as saying: “Judah is my commander’s staff.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 60:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 108:8</a>) While holding the “commander’s staff” seems to indicate that the possessor would be a leader with the power to command, a scepter in a monarch’s hand signifies his possession of regal sovereignty or prerogative as a royal ruler. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 45:6</a>) Therefore, the use of the terms “scepter” and “commander’s staff” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a> evidently indicates that significant authority and power would reside with the tribe of Judah. But that more than tribal authority and dominance were involved seems clear since Shiloh, to whom “the obedience of the people will belong,” was to come from the tribe of Judah. That circumstance betokens royal authority and power over the people. When Judah’s descendant David became the king of Israel, the scepter and commander’s staff proved to be in the possession of the tribe of Judah and these would not depart from it before the coming of Shiloh, the Messiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:8-16</a>) God has indeed given the Shiloh to come, Jesus Christ, a descendant of Judah and David, as “a leader and commander to the national groups.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 55:4</a>) It was foretold that the Messianic Ruler would exercise dominance and power over the nations and peoples. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 2:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010997/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Dan. 7:13, 14</a>) Hence, he not only holds the “scepter” or royal sovereignty but also possesses the “commander’s staff,” having the power to command.—See SHILOH.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"></p>

<strong>What Price Government?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible speaks of the “throne” or “seat” of the “wild beast.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1, 2</a>; <em>AV</em>) Would this mean the capital city of the world power that happened to rule at any period of history? We know that during the rule of the seven world powers the capital city representing the dominant world power has changed with the change of political control. From the seventeenth century up until World War II, England dominated as the world power and in the <span id="page664" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="664" data-before-text="664"></span>latter part of this period was joined by the United States; but during that time the British Empire was the stronger member, its capital being London, England. After World War II the United States became the stronger one of the dual world power, its capital being located in Washington, D.C. Would this be what could be called now the seat or “throne of the wild beast,” since it is the stronger one of the present Seventh World Power?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A throne stands for the seat of rulership or of kingdom. The throne would be the office or dignity of the government as a sovereign. Its location would have reference to the basis of its authority or that on which rests the grant of the power and authority to act in a sovereign way.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For example, the first prophecy uttered, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>, gave the promise of a seed to crush the serpent’s head. This promise was directed toward Abraham when God told him that his seed would take possession of the gate of his enemies, indicating that the seed would rule. The seed would bear the scepter of rulership and was to be known as Shiloh, meaning “the one whose it is.” These promises reveal that the seed to come would have his rulership by authority from Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 22:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 49:10</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">David, who as king foreshadowed Jesus Christ the King of the kingdom of God, was said to sit upon “Jehovah’s throne.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>) Jehovah was therefore the Source and Foundation of David’s power and authority as ruler. Of Jesus, it was prophetically said in the Psalms: “God is your throne to time indefinite, even forever; the scepter of your kingship is a scepter of uprightness.” The apostle Paul actually applied this text to Jesus where he said: “But with reference to the Son: ‘God is your throne forever, and the scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of uprightness.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 45:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:8</a>) From these things we see that Jesus’ throne, which means his office or authority as sovereign, has its source in Jehovah. Jehovah is the Originator and Giver of his throne. Christ’s kingdom would therefore carry out the purposes of Jehovah and bring honor to him.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Certainly the basis for the throne of the “wild beast” is not in Jehovah God’s promise of the Messiah, the Seed of his heavenly woman. It is not a throne “by the grace of God.” Revelation says: “The dragon gave the beast its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 13:2</a>) The “throne of the wild beast” was given by the Dragon, Satan the Devil. The “throne” functions within the allowance of activity and time that Jehovah God granted to Satan the Devil to carry out his enmity against the Seed of the woman and to bruise the heel of the Messianic Seed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) God did not give the Dragon or the beast its authority. He did, however, permit the Dragon, Satan the Devil, to exist because of the issue that was raised in the universe regarding the rightfulness and righteousness of Jehovah God’s sovereignty, God allowing a time for all creatures in the universe to be able to take a stand on the issue.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>THE PRICE PAID</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">But what price did the “wild beast” pay for this grant of authority from the Dragon? We can be sure that it was not a free grant to the “wild beast.” The “wild beast” must have had to give the Dragon something in repayment. What? We can see what the Dragon required of the “wild beast” when we see what the Devil required of Jesus Christ when trying to tempt him with the gift of the kingdoms of earth. “The Devil said to him: ‘I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it. You, <span id="page665" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="665" data-before-text="665"></span>therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966803/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-7</a>.</p>

Your arrows are sharp—under you peoples keep falling—in the heart of the enemies of the king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At Armageddon the King Jesus Christ takes his sword, with which to cut down and destroy the nations that are ruining the earth. Besides girding upon him this executioner’s authority pictured by the sword, he girds upon himself dignity and splendor, going forth in the glorious role of Jehovah’s King and Vindicator. God’s Warrior-King rides to the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” in the cause of truth, to establish the truth of all of God’s written Word. He rides his symbolic war mount to Armageddon to vindicate Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and sanctify the divine name—the greatest act of righteousness. He rides on to victory also in the cause of establishing righteousness in all the universe. The book of Revelation pictures the King riding a white horse and having a bow with which to shoot arrows at all his enemies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 6:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19:11-16</a>) This skilled Archer does not miss his targets, so as to kill off righteous persons; but he speeds his arrows of destruction to the heart of all those who oppose God’s righteous new world. No enemies of righteousness will survive the King’s victorious ride that ensures the triumphant entry of a righteous new world.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>RIGHTEOUS RULER AND GOVERNMENT</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">After describing the King’s Armageddon ride in the cause of righteousness, the inspired psalmist gives us assurance that the government of the new world will never be corrupted, since it is written concerning its Ruler: “God is your throne to time indefinite, even forever; the scepter of your kingship is a scepter of uprightness. You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness. That is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 45:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Jesus Christ was anointed with the “oil of exultation” when he was installed in his heavenly throne as King A.D. 1914, in fulfillment of Bible prophecies, as this journal has often explained. That was a time of exultation for Jesus Christ, a most refreshing experience after he had waited for nineteen centuries at God’s right hand. Having been ushered into the joy of being Jehovah’s reigning King over all the universe, he will never abuse his power. The scepter of his kingship is one of uprightness, one in which there will never be the least bit of crookedness. Jesus proved his love for righteousness and his hatred for wickedness when he was on the earth, proving it even down to death in faithfulness to God. But now he has been raised from the dead and placed in a responsible position where he can fight for righteousness and enforce it with all the needed power in heaven and on earth. Moreover, he does not change, since “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In view of this assurance from God, let all persons who have longed for a righteous government look to Jehovah’s King, rejoicing in the knowledge that he will never turn to crookedness and oppression. The kingdom of God in the hands of Jesus Christ will be the righteous “new heavens” of that new world, and God’s promise will be fulfilled, just as the apostle Peter declared after he described the uncovering and punishing of all unrighteousness: “But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p>

More than any of them, Jesus has cause for exultation, or intense joy, at his anointing. Why? His reward is far greater than theirs, his kingship infinitely more beneficial. He is rewarded because his love of righteousness and hatred of wickedness moved him to obey God in all things.</p>

Jesus was anointed with “the oil of exultation more than [his] partners” (the other kings of the line of David). This was by reason of his receiving the anointing directly from Jehovah himself, not with oil but with holy spirit, not to an earthly kingship but to a heavenly one combined with the office of heavenly High Priest.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000285/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Heb 1:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000285/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Ps 45:7</a>.</p>

That is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.” These words we recognize to be the ones quoted by the apostle Paul to prove Christ’s superiority over the angels. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979045/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 1:7-9</a>) Because he loved righteousness and hated wickedness or lawlessness, Christ’s scepter was bound to be wielded in behalf of uprightness. This betokens good for mankind.</p>

For example, he minced no words when exposing the religious hypocrites of his day.

This one does not fail in the crucial hour. He is the Founder of the real Christianity, Jehovah’s anointed King, Christ Jesus. The psalmist writes of him, prophetically: “You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness. That is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 45:7</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> One of Jesus’ “partners” in the Kingdom covenant, which Jehovah made with David, was Ahaz’s son, good King Hezekiah. His name means “Jehovah Has Strengthened.” It appears that, even before Jehovah established Hezekiah as king in Judah, he may have served for a time as coregent with Ahaz. No doubt he then began to show strength in behalf of true worship. Today, also, Christ began to do a preparatory work among sincere Christians on earth prior to receiving his kingdom. It was in this connection that the <em>Watchtower</em> magazine began to be published in 1879, in strong support of the Christian doctrine of the ransom and other Bible truths.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20.

Look! He will certainly come,’ Jehovah of armies has said. . . . ‘And he must sit as a refiner and cleanser of silver and must cleanse the sons of Levi; . . . and they will certainly become to Jehovah people presenting a gift offering in righteousness.

At times what is bad may be very temptingly presented to us, even as was the forbidden fruit to Eve; and so unless we have cultivated a loathing for what is bad, an abhorrence and hatred for it, in a moment of weakness we may succumb to temptation, to our lasting shame and regret. No one may take for granted that because of his many years as a dedicated Christian he has a firm position.

If we are fond of alcoholic beverages to the extent of not being able to control that fondness, we must exercise a tight rein when in the presence of those indulging in them, preferably staying away from such places, or we may bring dishonor to the Christian congregation and deserve to be chastised. If our weakness is along the lines of sex, whether married or single, then we must wage a strong fight against that weakness, avoiding unclean thoughts, pornographic literature and sensual moving pictures. Remember, “there is nothing . . . secret that will not become known.” We must keep “bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.” We must ‘keep ourselves clean as carriers of Jehovah’s utensils’ if we would keep on walking with God, ‘exercising justice.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 10:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 10:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Isa. 52:11</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>“LOVE KINDNESS”</strong></p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">29.

Loving-kindness will make us understanding, considerate, gentle and helpful. To be kind we must have empathy. Empathy goes farther than sympathy, for in empathy we put ourselves in the other’s place, we actually feel what he feels. Jehovah God, great as he is, is not beyond exercising empathy regarding his creatures. He not only has pity, compassion, sympathy for us, remembering that we are but dust, but he puts himself in our place so that what hurts us hurts him. Thus we read regarding his nation of Israel: “During all their distress it was distressing to him.” Yes, when they suffered, he suffered.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa. 63:9</a>.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">31.

And once becoming a follower of Jesus Christ himself, Paul also imitated his Master in this matter of empathy. He put himself in the others’ place, that he might win them to Christ: To the Jew he became as a Jew, to those under the law, as under the law, to those without the law, as without law. “To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts . . . for the sake of the good news.” And once these had become his brothers Paul continued to manifest empathy: “Who is weak, and I am not weak?

Besides girding upon him this executioner’s authority pictured by the sword, he girds upon himself dignity and splendor, going forth in the glorious role of Jehovah’s King and Vindicator. God’s Warrior-King rides to the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” in the cause of truth, to establish the truth of all of God’s written Word. He rides his symbolic war mount to Armageddon to vindicate Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and sanctify the divine name—the greatest act of righteousness. He rides on to victory also in the cause of establishing righteousness in all the universe. The book of Revelation pictures the King riding a white horse and having a bow with which to shoot arrows at all his enemies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 6:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19:11-16</a>) This skilled Archer does not miss his targets, so as to kill off righteous persons; but he speeds his arrows of destruction to the heart of all those who oppose God’s righteous new world. No enemies of righteousness will survive the King’s victorious ride that ensures the triumphant entry of a righteous new world.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>RIGHTEOUS RULER AND GOVERNMENT</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">After describing the King’s Armageddon ride in the cause of righteousness, the inspired psalmist gives us assurance that the government of the new world will never be corrupted, since it is written concerning its Ruler: “God is your throne to time indefinite, even forever; the scepter of your kingship is a scepter of uprightness. You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness. That is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 45:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Jesus Christ was anointed with the “oil of exultation” when he was installed in his heavenly throne as King A.D. 1914, in fulfillment of Bible prophecies, as this journal has often explained. That was a time of exultation for Jesus Christ, a most refreshing experience after he had waited for nineteen centuries at God’s right hand. Having been ushered into the joy of being Jehovah’s reigning King over all the universe, he will never abuse his power. The scepter of his kingship is one of uprightness, one in which there will never be the least bit of crookedness. Jesus proved his love for righteousness and his hatred for wickedness when he was on the earth, proving it even down to death in faithfulness to God. But now he has been raised from the dead and placed in a responsible position where he can fight for righteousness and enforce it with all the needed power in heaven and on earth. Moreover, he does not change, since “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In view of this assurance from God, let all persons who have longed for a righteous government look to Jehovah’s King, rejoicing in the knowledge that he will never turn to crookedness and oppression. The kingdom of God in the hands of Jesus Christ will be the righteous “new heavens” of that new world, and God’s promise will be fulfilled, just as the apostle Peter declared after he described the uncovering and punishing of all unrighteousness: “But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p>

The most wonderful way in which he has done this has been in the sending of his Son to earth, to live among us for a while as a man. John makes this clear in his Gospel. He tells us about Jesus in his prehuman existence, then known as “the Word,” and rightly called “a god,” <span id="page209" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="209" data-before-text="209"></span>a mighty one, for “all things came into existence through him.” Then, after telling how “the Word became flesh,” he says: “No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is in the bosom position with the Father is the one that has explained him.” We could not wish for a finer help in our study than this introduction to the one who enjoyed such a close relationship with his Father, and who came to earth so that he could explain him to us.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 103:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> John 1:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 18</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="qu"> 4.

After describing the initial preparations for earth’s creation, God’s Son, the Word, says: “Then I came to be beside him as a master worker, and I came to be the one he was specially fond of day by day, . . . and the things I was fond of were with the sons of men.” What an appealing picture of family life, with a Father specially fond of his Son, and the Son, in turn, very fond of that which we know is now given into his care by his Father, those things bound up with the human family.

(b) What fine contrast is seen in Jesus, and how is it demonstrated?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[23]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> As we read about Jesus in the Scriptures, what are our impressions? He was dynamic, yet mild. By general standards this seems impossible. We usually think of a dynamic person as being forceful, ambitious, overriding and impatient of anyone getting in his way, whereas we think of a mild person as being placid, not holding very strong opinions, and ready to give way for the sake of peace, rather than stand up for what is right. Due to imperfection, our various characteristics are not properly balanced and tend to go to extremes, but this is not so with one who is perfect, as was Jesus. That which perhaps gives us the best key to his personality is the word spoken prophetically of him by David, and quoted by Paul at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:9</a>, where we read: “You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.” (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 45:7</a>.) Jesus was and is a great lover of righteousness, including a deep and tender love for those who, though imperfect, sincerely strive after righteousness. To such he is mild, peaceable, friendly and very patient. At the same time he has a strong hatred for all that is lawless, including those who prove they are willfully committed to their evil ways. As he expressed scathing denunciation for the hypocritical religious leaders of his day, who relentlessly showed murderous hostility toward “that holy and righteous one,” so he likewise expresses himself to that same class today, saying: “Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 3:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matt. 7:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 23:13-39</a>) Jesus’ personality does not change. He is the “same yesterday and today, and forever.” Thus there is exemplified in Jesus the same balanced contrast as seen in Jehovah, and also as demonstrated by Jehovah’s people today, the fierceness of a lion, coupled with the mildness of refreshing dew.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 13:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Mic. 5:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="qu"> 6.

Well, the Bible was written for the benefit of God’s friends, not his enemies. It is worth noting how Jesus spoke to his friends when on earth. What was their impression of him? It is very evident that, though acknowledged as their “Teacher” <span id="page210" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="210" data-before-text="210"></span>and “Lord,” he did not hold himself aloof, or overawe them, intimidating them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 13:13</a>) Instead, he brought them into close union with himself and made them feel at home in his presence. His manner and way of speaking contributed to that end. They found his presence refreshing, and Jesus himself gave the reason for this, saying: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you . . . for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963244/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28, 29</a>.</p>

<strong>Life in a Righteous New World</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span id="page164" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>The judgment God executed upon the preflood world and upon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah was prophetic; that is, it set “a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come.” The coming event that all righteous persons long for is God’s war of Armageddon, when the Lord Jesus Christ as Jehovah’s reigning King puts an end to all manner of unrighteousness.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">No unproved King is the Lord Jesus Christ, for he was thoroughly tried and tested as to his love for righteousness. When on earth he spurned the Devil’s offer for rulership over this unrighteous world. He stayed loyal to his Father and the divine principles of righteousness. Applying <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960200/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 45:7</a> to Jesus Christ, the inspired writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960200/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:8, 9</a> says: “But with reference to the Son: ‘God is your throne forever, and the scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of straight principles. You loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.’” How thrilling to our hearts this assurance that the King of the new world loves righteousness, that his very scepter is one of “straight principles”! Further, since it is said of God’s King that “God is your throne forever,” we have another guarantee of the new world’s righteousness; for at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960200/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 97:2</a> we read of God’s throne: “Righteousness and judgment are the established place of his throne.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The end, then, of all fraudulent practices, oppression, selfishness and wickedness is at hand. Rejoice in the knowledge that within this generation men of good will toward God, men who love righteousness, will be delivered by God so as to gain entrance into a world in which “righteousness is to dwell.” Giving this prophetic foregleam of life in the righteous new world under the King with the scepter of straight principles, the psalmist says: “O God, give your own judicial decisions to the king, and your righteousness to the son of the king. May he plead the cause of your people with righteousness and of your afflicted ones with judicial decision. Let the mountains carry peace to the people, also the hills, through righteousness. . . . In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960200/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 72:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">No unrighteousness will take root in that new world. Only the “righteous one will sprout.” Gone, then, appalling housing shortages, vanished the food shortages. Even now, says Dr. Josué de Castro, “the world has at its disposal enough resources to provide an adequate diet for everybody, everywhere.” Indeed, some governments have great food surpluses that are either stored up, destroyed or disposed of in some other manner. Yet millions of persons starve on an earth capable of producing an abundance for all. Life in God’s righteous new world will not be one of shortages of any kind. Then, earth-wide, Isaiah’s prophecy will have a literal fulfillment: “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.” “And the work of the true righteousness must become peace, and the service of the true righteousness quietness and security to time indefinite.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960200/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 65:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960200/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 32:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">How may you enjoy everlasting life on earth in a righteous world?

<strong>Why Maturity of Discernment Vital</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[23]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Taking up the first question, we ask: What are Jehovah’s powers of perception and his attitude regarding evil and evildoers? Taking a comprehensive view, we are amazed and awe-struck at the penetrating discernment possessed and exercised by the Most High. The following are but two examples: “Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.” “There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:9</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>, <em>NW</em>) No getting away from it, is there? Especially when we remember that “God, who endowed man with mind, knows how the mind operates . . . [He] instantly detects the bent of man’s mind and knows what it will lead to. That is <span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>why he gives warning to us against the consequences that are sure to follow.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1952645/0/0">October 15, 1951, <em>Watchtower,</em> p. 619, ¶ 11</a>) The same applies to the spirit creation, including the cherub who was later known as Satan the Devil. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Col. 1:16</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jehovah knows exactly how evil operates from its earliest inception. Nothing too subtle, nothing too crooked in mind or heart, but that he can read it like an open book. But, before probing farther into this particular aspect, let us take up the next question we promised to consider.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="qu"> 4. Is the Bible explicit concerning Christ’s powers of perception?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[24]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> What of Christ’s perception and attitude as to evil and evildoers? Not only at the first advent did he manifest keen discernment of both friend and foe, but much greater powers are exercised by him at the second advent. Not merely generally, but of individuals, as shown by his following words: “All the congregations will know that I am he who <em>searches the inmost thoughts and hearts,</em> and I will give to you <em>individually</em> according to your deeds.” And surely the <em>living</em> Word, Christ Jesus, would not reasonably have lesser powers of perception than those credited to the <em>written</em> Word!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 1:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rev. 2:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Heb. 4:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Luke 9:47;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/6/4" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 20:23</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="qu"> 5.

Let us take timely warning, realizing we are now in the day of judgment. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mal. 3:1-3</a>, <em>AS</em>) Let us not be so foolish as to think for a moment we can deceive, or hide anything in our private lives or inmost hearts from the One to whom the Father has committed all judgment. Let us honestly and humbly search our own hearts, for “if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged. However, when we are judged, we are disciplined by Jehovah, that we may not become condemned with the world”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:31, 32</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="qu"> 6. Does Scripture clearly reveal the attitude of the higher powers toward evil, and how can the answer be said to be a mature one?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> We have not yet said anything on the question of the <em>attitude</em> toward evil and evildoers on the part of Jehovah and his beloved Son. The scripture we wish to refer to particularly is addressed to the Son, but it also reveals the heavenly Father’s attitude on the same question. We quote from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:9</a> (<em>NW</em>), which, in turn, is a quotation from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 45:7</a>: “You loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of great joy more so than your partners.” This expression ‘you hated lawlessness’ gives, not only a straight answer to our question, but a <em>mature</em> one. It presents <em>both</em> sides of the matter, hence a completely balanced conception, true and strong, of Christ’s own mature attitude of mind and heart toward both righteousness and lawlessness, and which gained for him unqualified approval and a reward above all others.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 7. (a) Appreciation of such mature answer gives what practical guidance? (b) How are we encouraged to strive for such maturity, and to what end?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> See how this becomes an invaluable guide individually. It is of little use, your saying and claiming to have a hatred of all lawlessness, unless at the same time you give practical evidence of an equally intense love for righteousness, God’s righteous cause and sacred service. Do you? On the other hand, it is of little use, your saying and claiming to have a love for righteousness, if at the same time you condone or indulge in something contrary to God’s law according to the high standard given by Jesus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 5:21-28</a> (<em>NW</em>). We are encouraged to press on toward this same maturity in our attitude by considering closely and looking intently at the Leader and Perfecter of our faith, who, for the great joy set before him, endured so much <span id="page530" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="530" data-before-text="530"></span>in manifesting his burning love for righteousness and intense hatred of lawlessness. And with what benefit to ourselves? “That you may not get tired and give out in your souls.” That is one of the most valued blessings maturity brings, namely, steadfastness and dependability.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952645/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 12:1-3</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

The tree is large and spreading, at times reaching a height of 30 m (c. 100 ft). The inner core of the trunk and of branches is impregnated with resin and an odoriferous oil, from which comes the highly prized perfume. Apparently attaining its most aromatic state when in decay, the wood is sometimes buried in the ground to hasten the decaying process. In a finely powdered condition it is then sold commercially as “aloes.”</p>

The inner bark of the branches (called cassia lignea), when cut, dries and peels off, rolling itself into tubes, which are then sent to market. The cassia bark is coarser and more pungent than cinnamon bark. The buds are used as cloves in preparing food dishes, and the mature flowers, when dried, serve as an aromatic incense.</p>

Already hundreds of thousands of the sons of men to whom the glory of the splendor of Jehovah’s kingship has been made known in more than a hundred languages have believed and accepted the Kingdom message and are rejoicing in it. More than that, they are acting upon it in fulfillment of the psalmist’s prayer: “The praise of Jehovah my mouth will speak, and let all flesh bless his holy name to time indefinite, even forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 145:21</a>) They too have become Kingdom witnesses of Jehovah.</p><p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="qu">34.

They have been begotten or engendered by Jehovah God by means of his life-giving spirit and so they have become as a daughter to the great King of eternity, Jehovah, the universal Sovereign. Now that the kingdom of God’s dear Son, their Bridegroom, has been established, the time draws near for their marriage to him in the “first resurrection.” Now as the remnant of the bride class approach the wedding day they are telling all lovers of divine government about their Bridegroom, who has been made King at Jehovah’s right hand in heaven. As they move on through this world to their final union with the Bridegroom they are joined by well-wishing companions who want to become subjects of their Bridegroom King.

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p>

<strong>Bringing the Holy Place into Right Condition</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> According to the Sacred Scriptures, the “sanctuary” of God is his temple of worship. It is his “palace,” according to another meaning of the word that the Scriptures use for “temple” (<em>hei·khalʹ,</em> Hebrew).

To these he is the God Ruler or Theocrat. It is from there that he exercises theocratic rule or government. It is the center of his theocracy. A good definition for this governmental term “theocracy” is given in M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia,</em> Volume 10, page 317, which says: “A form of government such as prevailed among the ancient Jews, in which Jehovah, the God of the universe, was directly recognised as their supreme civil ruler, and his laws were taken as the statute-book of the kingdom. This principle is repeatedly laid down in the Mosaic code, and was continually acted upon thereafter.”</p>

In the new world, Jesus will appoint “princes in all the earth” to take the lead among Jehovah’s worshipers on earth.

This psalm is prophetically addressed to Jesus Christ as the installed King: “In place of your [earthly] forefathers there will come to be your sons, whom you will appoint as princes in all the earth.” This psalm emphasizes that Jesus Christ will become a heavenly father to children down here on the earth and that he will install sons from among them as “princes in all the earth.” As the “son of David” and as the firstborn son of the Judean virgin Mary, Jesus had earthly human forefathers all the way back to the first father, Adam.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989604/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 3:23-38</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989604/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 45:16</a> saying that those who were formerly Jesus’ natural forefathers will become his sons by his resurrecting of them from the dead?

No. Fulfillment of the prophecy in such a way would allow for only a limited number of “princes” in all the earth. Besides that fact, not all these forefathers of his were so outstanding as to merit special prominence on earth during his Millennial Reign. The King, Jesus Christ, will have countless more than his earthly forefathers to appoint as “princes”​—qualified ones of the Armageddon survivors, of the resurrected “other sheep,” including the pre-Christian men of faith. From among all of these, he can appoint qualified deserving ones to hold princely office as his earthly representatives.</p>

<strong>Conventions Proof of Our Brotherhood</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">On the next-to-last day of that convention, F. W. Franz, then vice president of the Watch Tower Society, addressed the audience on “New Systems of Things.” For many years Jehovah’s Witnesses had believed that even before Armageddon some of Jehovah’s pre-Christian servants would be raised from the dead to be princes of the new world, in fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101993020/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 45:16</a>. You can imagine, then, the effect on the vast audience when the speaker asked: “Would this international assembly be happy to know that <em>here, tonight,</em> in our midst, there are a number of prospective <em>princes of the new earth?”</em> There was tremendous and sustained applause along with shouts of joy. Then the speaker showed that the Biblical use of the term translated “prince” along with the record of faithfulness of many of the “other sheep” in modern times allowed for the belief that some now living might well be selected by Jesus Christ for princely service. He also pointed out, however, that there would be no bestowing of titles on those entrusted with such service. Concluding his discourse, he urged: “Onward, then, steadily, all of us together, as a New World society!”</p>

Surely if we are to be among those who are blessed with what Adam lost, we must give evidence that we pay attention when God speaks. And how will he speak to us during the Millennium to come, while mankind is being brought to perfection? Through the Messianic Kingdom. Will that government also have visible earthly representatives? Yes.

Here are some vivid recollections: “I recall the gasp of amazement that swept the assembly, and we began looking around us expectantly . . . was David here, or Abraham, or Daniel, or Job? Many of us sisters had tears in our eyes!” (Grace A. Estep) “I was so excited I sat on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued on the dugout. I was certain that one or more of these men <span id="page214" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="214" data-before-text="214"></span>of old would emerge at any moment.” (Sister Dwight T. Kenyon) “People in the corridors rushed to the stadium entrances to view the speaker’s stand, perhaps expecting to see Abraham, David or maybe Moses. The audience stood up​—the atmosphere was charged. I am sure that if someone with a long beard had walked to the platform there would have been no containing the crowd.”​—L. E. Reusch.</p><p id="p166" data-pid="166" class="sb">A profound silence next settled over the audience. Every ear seemed strained to lose none of the speaker’s words. He discussed the real meaning of the Hebrew word translated ‘prince.” He pointed out that today’s “other sheep” have suffered just as much for their faith as did Jehovah’s witnesses of old. Hence, nothing argues against Christ’s making these “other sheep” “princes in all the earth” as required. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/301975006/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 45:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/301975006/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>) Then, concluding his discourse, Brother Franz said: “With the transporting prospects so close before us, oh! let us keep Theocratic organization and let God continue improving it as a New World society. Never may we look back to this modern Sodom, which is reserved for destruction, but we are determined to keep faces forward in full faith. Onward, then, steadily, all of us together, as a New World society!”</p>

<strong>Would You Want to Be There?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Who will be the visible administrators of righteousness in the “new earth”? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974360/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 45</a> tells us. It is addressed prophetically to David’s kingly heir, the Lord Jesus Christ. After describing the heavenly “marriage” of Jesus Christ and his “bridal” congregation, the psalm says: “In place of your forefathers there will come to be your sons, whom you will appoint as princes in all the earth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974360/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 45 Vs. 16</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Who are the “princes” that will help in carrying out justice in the “new earth”? Some of them will be chosen from among Jesus’ ancestors. They, though forefathers of Jesus in a fleshly sense, will be dependent on him for life. These men he will resurrect from the dead, Jesus becoming their “Father,” and they his “sons.” Others will also serve as “princes” from among the survivors of this system’s destruction and from among faithful men of old not in Jesus’ ancestry.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The primary factor qualifying these princes is integrity. Jesus Christ will follow God’s own principle in selecting these men, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974360/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 18:21</a>: You should select “capable men, fearing God, trustworthy men, hating unjust profit.” These princes will not be corruptible, as rulers are today. They will be courageous and protective of what is right, like the princes described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974360/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:1, 2</a>:</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">“Look! A king will reign for righteousness itself; and as respects princes, they will rule as princes for justice itself. And each one must prove to be like a hiding place from the wind and a place of concealment from the rainstorm, like streams of water in a waterless country, like the shadow of a heavy crag in an exhausted land.” All, regardless of race, color or former nationality, will receive justice. There will be no need of lawyers fighting for civil rights. Justice will not be meted out on the basis of any economic, social or ethnic status.</p>

Beginning with the April 1, 1935, issue of <em>The Watchtower</em> the announcements thereof said: “Again <em>The Watchtower</em> reminds its readers that a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses and Jonadabs<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966124/2">c</a> will be held at Washington, D.C., beginning May 30 and ending June 3, 1935. It is hoped that many of the remnant and the Jonadabs may find it convenient to attend the convention. Heretofore not many Jonadabs have had the privilege of attending a convention, and the convention at Washington may be a real comfort and benefit to them.” (Page 98) “This is a service convention, and it is expected that all <span id="page121" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="121" data-before-text="121"></span>the remnant and the Jonadabs will participate in the service.”—Page 110.</p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">23.

On the second afternoon of this convention (May 31), the then president of the Watch Tower Society addressed the visible audience at the Washington Auditorium and also invisible audiences over radio stations WBBR and WHPA on the subject “The Great Multitude” as foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966124/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-17</a> (<em>AV</em>)<em>.</em> In this speech he pointed out that the long-discussed secondary spiritual class did not exist and that the picture of the “great multitude” applied to no such class. Rather, the “great multitude” was made up of the modern-day Jonadabs, and these had to show the same degree of faithfulness to Jehovah God as the spiritual remnant.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">24.

Later the <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</em> for 1936 (page 63) said: “This revelation stirred the brethren and stimulated them to renewed activities, and everywhere throughout the earth come the reports exhibiting joy in the fact that the remnant now have the privilege of carrying the message to the great multitude, and these together working to the honor of the Lord’s name.”</p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">25.

If the reigning King Jesus Christ restricted the appointment of princes in all the earth to only the godly forefathers of his, there would not be many such princes in all the earth. Other ancient men were equally faithful among that “so great a cloud of witnesses.” So it is only reasonable that such faithful witnesses would likewise be considered worthy to be appointed as princes in various parts of the earth.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Their appointment to princely office argues that they would be resurrected earlier than the other earthly subjects of God’s kingdom.

<strong>Joseph—a Faithful Witness of Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Joseph was so greatly touched by Judah’s plea that he could no longer contain himself. Ordering all strangers from his <span id="page155" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="155" data-before-text="155"></span>presence, he made himself known to his brothers. Faithful witness that he was, Joseph told his brothers not to be angry with themselves, “because for the preservation of life God has sent me ahead of you.” This was the second year of famine and there would be five more, “consequently God sent me ahead of you in order to place survivors of yourselves in the earth . . . So now it was not you who sent me here, but it was God.” Yes, God, God, God, was being honored by Joseph. What a good example to follow!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 45:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Joseph then loaded his brothers down with gifts, and, with the wise and knowing counsel, “Do not get exasperated at one another during the trip,” sent them back to their father in Canaanland. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 45:24</a>) With what joy 130-year-old Jacob finally accepted the good news that Joseph was alive! “Ah, let me go and see him before I die!” Because of the famine Joseph sent an invitation for his father and all his household to come to Egypt, which they did. Pharaoh gave them the choice section of Goshen, where they settled down and were nourished during the remaining years of the famine.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 45:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 47:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">As the famine continued year after year the Egyptians gradually exhausted all their possessions to buy food and in the end even sold themselves to Pharaoh that they might live. This permitted Joseph to settle them where he saw best. He gave them seed for their crops of which they were required to pay back one fifth to Pharaoh for the use of the land.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 47:13-26</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">When Jacob died, within his 147th year, Joseph respected his request to be buried in the field of Ephron where Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah and Leah were buried. But now that their father was dead, Joseph’s half brothers, still plagued by a guilty conscience, feared how they would fare at Joseph’s hands. Here again Joseph honored his God by his speech and conduct, saying to them: “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? As for you, you had evil in mind against me. God had it in mind for good for the purpose of acting as at this day to preserve many people alive. So now do not be afraid. I myself shall keep supplying you and your little children with food.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 49:29-32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 50:15-21</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Joseph survived his father by fifty-five years, reaching the age of 110 years. Just before his death he once more showed himself to be a faithful witness by referring to God’s promise to Abraham: “By faith Joseph, nearing his end, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and he gave a command concerning his bones,” namely, that when the Israelites finally left Egypt they were to take his bones along with them. No doubt this command of Joseph served as an added ray of hope to the children of Israel during the long years that they endured tyrannical bondage in Egypt.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Heb. 11:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Gen. 50:24</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Truly Joseph was a faithful witness of Jehovah. He brought honor to his God by his conduct toward his brothers, in Potiphar’s house, in the king’s prison and as Egypt’s food administrator. And never did he miss an opportunity to witness to the supremacy of his God: to Potiphar’s wife, to his fellow prisoners, to Pharaoh and then repeatedly to his brothers. Surely the record of his life helps to equip us completely for every good work.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">In addition to his exemplary life, Joseph is of interest to us because Jehovah God used him to picture the true Savior of the world, Jesus Christ, the great Administrator of spiritual food. And for his course of faithfulness Joseph in the resurrection will be one of those from among whom Christ, the One whom he pictured, will appoint princes in all the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961168/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 45:16</a>.</p>

Later our father said, ‘Return, buy a little food for us.’ But we said, ‘We are not able to go down. If our youngest brother is with us we will go down, because we are not able to see the man’s face in case our youngest brother is not with us.’ Then your slave my father said to us, ‘You yourselves well know that my wife bore but two sons to me. Later the one went out from my company and I exclaimed, “Ah, he must surely be torn to pieces!” and I have not seen him till now. <span id="page223" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="223" data-before-text="223"></span>If you were to take this one also out of my sight and a fatal accident were to befall him, you would certainly bring down my gray hairs with calamity to Sheol.’</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">“And now, as soon as I should come to your slave my father without the boy along with us, when that one’s soul is bound up with this one’s soul, then it is certain to occur that as soon as he sees that the boy is not there he will simply die and your slaves will indeed bring down the gray hairs of your slave our father with grief to Sheol. For your slave became surety for the boy when away from his father, saying, ‘If I fail to bring him back to you, then I shall have sinned against my father forever.’ So now, please, let your slave stay instead of the boy as a slave to my master, that the boy may go up with his brothers. For how can I go up to my father without the boy along with me, for fear that then I may look upon the calamity that will find out my father?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961249/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 44:18-34</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">After such a stirring appeal it is no wonder that “Joseph was no longer able to control himself,” and, alone with his brothers, he made himself known to them! After this reconciliation Judah and his brothers were loaded down with gifts. What good news they had for their father! ‘Joseph is alive and he wants you and all your household to come to Egypt to live!’ Then, as Jacob and his household neared Egypt, Jacob, fittingly, “sent Judah in advance of him to Joseph to impart information ahead of him to Goshen.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961249/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 45:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961249/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 46:28</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>PROPHETIC IMPORT</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The last time we see Judah is at the deathbed of his father, when he and his brothers were called together to hear Jacob’s final “commands to his sons,” consisting of censure, commendation and prophecy. For his first three sons he had only stern rebukes: ‘Reuben, you defiled my lounge!’ ‘Simeon and Levi, cursed be your anger.’ But for Judah, aged Jacob had words of commendation: “Judah, your brothers will praise you. Your hand will be on the back of the neck of your enemies. The sons of your father will bow down to you. A lion cub Judah is. . . . who dares rouse him? The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to him the obedience of the people will belong.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961249/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 49:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Truly Judah showed himself to be superior to his brothers in time of stress. He took the lead in what turned out for the best. And most important of all, Jehovah’s blessing was upon his efforts. He was free from malice and ill will. He showed loving concern for his father, for Joseph and for Benjamin.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Judah’s tribe became the most numerous and the royal one, through which came the Kingdom covenant from David to Jesus Christ. What an honor was his to be an ancestor of the Messiah, and for that one to take his name, “Lion that is of the tribe of Judah”! Though now sleeping in death, he lives in God’s memory. In God’s due time he will be resurrected, doubtless to be made a prince in the new world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961249/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961249/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 7:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961249/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Ps. 45:16</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">In addition to the lessons to be learned from Judah’s course, his life appears also to have been part of a prophetic drama. As at one time Judah was associated with those who hated Joseph, so today there are persons who at one time were associated with the enemies of God’s people. However, because of a good heart condition these are susceptible to the truth of God’s Word and, upon coming in touch with it, make a change by taking their stand with God’s people, even as Judah pleaded in behalf of Benjamin. Those doing so can hope to be rewarded both now and in God’s new world of righteousness so near at hand.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"></p>

It has a capital in the heavens, called Zion, and from this vantage point, the King Jesus Christ will effectively administer all the earth in righteousness.

Among them will be men trained to care for the affairs of the new world in many capacities. Look at Moses, the lawgiver. Where among the judges of this world could we find a man as well qualified to administer justice? He was well trained during the years he led the Israelites from slavery in Egypt to the border of the Promised Land. Then there was Joseph as a food administrator. He saved Egypt from famine and starvation by carefully storing up extra food during the years of plenty and then distributing it during the years of famine. David was a man used to administer righteous laws for the good of the nation over which he ruled as king.

For about 6,000 years he has largely dominated the human race and his influence among men has caused trouble, sorrow, pain and death. He has reproached the name of Jehovah and persecuted all who stood for that name. Now his time is up and shortly he will see his wicked organization destroyed at the battle of Armageddon, following which he will be sealed in the abyss of inactivity. As stated in preceding paragraphs, that battle will be the most terrible trouble the earth will ever have witnessed. Jehovah has given us several pictures of it and its severity; for example, the flood of Noah’s day, when all creatures on earth, except those in the ark, were destroyed by the watery deluge. Noah was a preacher of righteousness and warned the people of the coming disaster, but they went right ahead with their affairs of life and paid no attention to the warning Jehovah sent them. When the flood came it was too late to seek refuge in the ark, and all, save eight souls, went down to death.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">44.

Three nations, representing the three divisions of Satan’s organization, religion, politics and commerce, united to destroy Jerusalem and the typical theocracy that had been launched for Israel. King Jehoshaphat was fearful of this great army made up of men of Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir, and called the people to the temple to pray for Jehovah’s protection. Jehovah told the people of Israel not to <span id="page443" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="443" data-before-text="443"></span>be afraid because of the armies of the enemy, for the battle was not theirs but God’s. They were just to sing the praises of Jehovah and leave the rest to Him. This faithful course resulted in their deliverance. Moab and Ammon turned and fought against Mount Seir, and when they had destroyed her they fought against each other; and when they had finished that fight, there was not much left for Jehovah to destroy. All the while this fight was being waged the servants of Jehovah were singing his praises. So now, at Armageddon, the different parts of Satan’s organization will turn against and fight each other while Jehovah’s witnesses will be singing his praises and proclaiming the doom of Satan and his system of things.</p>

Then they were to be installed as princes over the rest of mankind and act as visible representatives of the heavenly kingdom of Christ Jesus. (<em>The Harp of God</em> [of 1921], ¶ 556) Because <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951881/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:1</a> mentions princes and connects them with the King of the new world it was thought that these princes were the same as those mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951881/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 45:16</a>. And so the verse, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951881/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:1</a>, was applied to the thousand-year reign of Christ Jesus after the battle of Armageddon. However, from and after 1947 the columns of <em>The Watchtower</em> have not been quoting <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951881/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:1</a> and applying it in that way.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 4.

Why your answer?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Please note that Isaiah does not say that these princes under the King of righteousness are his children or are limited to his children, the way <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951881/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 45:16</a> does. Consequently, Isaiah’s prophecy need not necessarily be confined to those who will become children of Christ Jesus, the “Everlasting Father”, and who as children of this royal Father are entitled to become princes by virtue of their birth from a royal ruler. Hence, too, fulfillment of the prophecy need not be delayed till after the battle of Armageddon when the Devil’s organization and its rulers and princes have been destroyed from the earth; nor till the resurrection of the faithful witnesses of ancient times, like Abel, Abraham, Moses and David, takes place.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 5.

The <em>King James Version</em> of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951881/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:2</a> reads: “And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers [streams, <em>AS</em>] of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.” Who the <em>man</em> here is has long been a question of interpretation. But now this is understood to be the Hebrew expression meaning “each one” or “everyone”, and so modern translators render it this way. <em>An American Translation</em> reads: “And princes will rule with justice; and each of them will be like a hiding-place from the wind, and a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a great rock in a wearisome land.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951881/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 32:1, 2</a>, <em>AT;</em> also <em>Crampon</em> and <em>Bover-Cantera</em>) Similarly <em>Moffatt</em> reads: “With princes that <span id="page718" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="718" data-before-text="718"></span>rule uprightly, each like a shelter from a storm,” etc. And Rotherham’s <em>Emphasised Bible</em> reads: “Yea, even princes with equity shall bear rule. So shall each one become as a hiding-place from the wind and a covert from the storm, as channels of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a massive cliff in a weary land.”—Also <em>Luther</em>.</p>

<strong>Theocratic Organization Re-established</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> There is no room for religious hypocrites among Jehovah’s theocratic people. If they want to practice ungodliness and the foolishness of this world; if they utter falsehood against Jehovah and do not want to work but selfishly enjoy things for themselves while they leave those who hunger and thirst after truth and righteousness unsatisfied, they have no place in official position, no, no place among Jehovah’s witnesses. The King of Righteousness will have his angels pitch them out from those who are lifting up the Signal of the Kingdom. In these days of warfare waged by the Greater Assyrian, Satan the Devil, against the remnant, Jehovah by his reigning King is protecting his organized people, just as the mountains surrounded faithful Jerusalem of old. For our day Jehovah has decreed: “The sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 125:3</a>, <em>AS</em>) He keeps the organized ruling powers of this world from overwhelming his people and from wielding influence over them to force them into iniquity or lawlessness against Jehovah God leading to their being cast away by Him. He will also watch over the internal condition of his people and see that no lawless person rises up and stays in control among his people who are seeking righteousness and meekness as subjects of the King of righteousness. And the “princes” whom the King has appointed by his theocratic organization to “rule in justice” <span id="page728" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="728" data-before-text="728"></span>will be watchful, too.

We have come out for God-rule in his organization. Appointment of his <em>sarím</em> in his visible organization is not by people’s rule or democratic process, but these are appointed by the reigning King through his theocratic organization.

Since the King Christ Jesus has gathered so many of his other sheep to his right hand and the flock of all his sheep has grown so numerous all over the earth, it has been necessary for him to appoint many of these other sheep to office. The facts show they too are carrying on in these princely functions, whether on a higher level or on a lower level, even if it means taking oversight over just a group of ten or less. These “other sheep” in office expect to become children of the “Everlasting Father”, Christ Jesus, during the millennial kingdom after the battle of Armageddon.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">14.

To realize their hope of being kings and priests with him in the heavenly government they must meet now the theocratic requirements in office. They must be just and must promote righteousness. Otherwise they will be rejected as unfaithful in a few things and will now lose the joy of their Lord and not be promoted to the heavenly kingship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 25:21</a>) The other sheep must likewise be faithful in what appointed service they now have. If proving faithful now in this time of test, they may have a continuance of their special service under their King, the “Everlasting Father”, and they may have a part after Armageddon in the realization of the prophecy: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 45:16</a>) Faithful men of old, resurrected, will share with them.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">15.

Such evil things create friction, strife, disruption. Instead, a loving friendship exists between them the same as existed between Jonathan and David of old. Jonathan was a prince in Israel as the son of King Saul and as captain of a thousand troops. David was also a prince as captain over a thousand troops and was also anointed to be future king of Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 18:13</a>) The other sheep, showing the humble attitude of Jonathan, recognize and submit to Jehovah’s appointment of his anointed remnant. They speak to the remnant as Jonathan did to David at their last meeting: “Thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Sam. 23:17</a>) They do not try to gain the ascendency over those of the remnant now or in the future. They hold fast to justice and support the remnant in their endeavors to <span id="page729" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="729" data-before-text="729"></span>serve Jehovah faithfully and gain the heavenly prize. They always do good to these brothers of the King, doing so as if to Him. On the other hand, the anointed remnant love these other sheep of the King. Since they must serve with justice, they safeguard the right of these ‘strangers within the gates of the organization’ and do not begrudge them service positions of responsibility such as they have enjoyed in God’s visible organization since 1935.</p>

For it will have new heavens and a new earth. The destruction of this old world with its Devil-controlled heavens and earth will therefore be no calamity. We eagerly look for it, doing as the apostle Peter says: “Awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, through which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved and the elements being intensely hot will melt. But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950802/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:12, 13</a>, <em>NW</em>) The kingdom of Jesus Christ, together with his 144,000 faithful victorious followers, will spread out its power over all this globe and will form the “new heavens”. To these spiritual followers Jesus has said: “There is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God that is not certain to get many times more in this period of time and in the coming system of things everlasting life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950802/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 18:29, 30</a>, <span id="page414" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="414" data-before-text="414"></span><em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950802/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 10:30</a>) The gospel account of Matthew speaks of the coming system and calls it the “re-creation” or the “new world”, saying: “In the re-creation [new world], when the Son of man sits down upon his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also yourselves sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone that has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive many times more and will inherit everlasting life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950802/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 19:28, 29</a>, <em>NW,</em> margin.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 3.

Well, it will be human society, on our same planet, of course, but organized according to a new and righteous system of things under the Kingdom. Doubtless the most of those who enter the “new earth” will have to be raised from the dead to do so. As Jesus said, when discussing the general resurrection of mankind: “The children of this system of things marry and are given in marriage, but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. In fact, neither can they die any more, for they are like the angels, and they are God’s children by being children of the resurrection.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950802/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 20:34-36</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 4.

They are the Right Shepherd’s “other sheep”. A “great crowd” of them which keeps increasing in number is now living with the remnant of Kingdom joint heirs who are under the new covenant. These “other sheep” are enjoying many of the benefits of the new covenant arrangement along with the spiritual remnant. Really, these present-day “other sheep” correspond with the “strangers” of good will who lived peaceably and harmoniously within the city gates of the ancient Israelites under the Law covenant. The Sabbath law of the Ten Commandments speaks of them prophetically as “thy stranger that is within thy gates”. That old covenant made many provisions for such God-fearing strangers. In many things it had the same ordinances for them as for the natural Israelites.

He did not say the king’s name. Really he did not, in fact, know the name of the king of whom he prophetically wrote under inspiration. But we today can identify the King of whom the psalmist prophetically <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>wrote, and we know his name. It is Jesus Christ, the Son of Jehovah God. Is his name worthy of being mentioned “throughout all generations to come”?

Even now by faith we can exult with His anointed King, for this King’s victory at Har–Magedon is certain and his reign over a cleansed earth for 1,000 years is sure. Ah, then, now​—today—​is the time favorable for us to put ourselves among those “peoples” who will laud the victorious King “to time indefinite, even forever.” This will redound to the glory of Jehovah God, his heavenly Father, who himself is the supreme “King of eternity” as well as the “King of the nations.” Our doing this will mean for us a life of lauding and of praising His anointed King “even forever.” This will impart real significance to life. It will set before us a lofty purpose for our living to all eternity.</p>

<strong>Alabaster</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of small perfume vaselike vessels originally made of a stone found near Alabastron, Egypt. The stone itself, a form <span id="page49" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="49" data-before-text="49"></span>of calcium carbonate, also came to be known by the same name. David collected “alabaster stones in great quantity” for the building of Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010191/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:2</a>) This ancient or “oriental alabaster” should not be confused with a modern alabaster, a hydrated calcium sulfate that is easily scratched. The original alabaster is usually white, and, due to being a stalagmite formation, sometimes has streaks of various colors. It approaches the hardness of marble but will not receive quite as high a polish. The solid alabaster was bored or drilled out to contain as much as a pound (.45 kilogram) of liquid. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010191/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 12:3</a>) It was usually fashioned with a narrow neck that could be effectively sealed to prevent the escape of the precious scent. When less costly materials such as gypsum were used to make such cases, these too were called alabasters simply because of the use to which they were put. However, cases made from geniune alabaster were used for the more costly ointments and perfumes, like those with which Jesus was anointed on two occasions—once in the house of a Pharisee in Galilee (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010191/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 7:37</a>), and once in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010191/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 26:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010191/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mark 14:3</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"></p>

<strong>From World Distress into a Peaceful “New Earth”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> With the figurative “heavens” and “elements” and “earth and the works in it” undergoing destruction, it might appear to Jehovah’s worshipers who are caught within this world distress without equal that the whole universe is crashing about them. Yes, as though the very ground were moving out from beneath their feet. To the earthly spectators the course of events may take on a frightful aspect. It will become manifest that only by a miracle of the Almighty God can anyone in the flesh on earth possibly survive. Only by reposing full trust in the Universal Sovereign Jehovah will earthly beholders keep from letting terror grip their hearts. Reserved for such an unsettling experience as that is the temple psalm of the sons of Korah, who survived the fiery destruction of their rebellious father and his presumptuous fellow Levites:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help that <span id="page353" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="353" data-before-text="353"></span>is readily to be found during distresses. That is why we shall not fear, though the earth undergo change and though the mountains totter into the heart of the vast sea; though its waters be boisterous, foam over, though the mountains rock at its uproar. . . . There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, the holiest grand tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of the city; it will not be made to totter. God will help it at the appearance of morning. The nations became boisterous, the kingdoms tottered; He sounded with his voice, the earth proceeded to melt. Jehovah of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is a secure height for us.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975079/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1-7 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975079/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> superscription</a>.</p>

Jehovah God, moreover, is nearer than any enemy. And as the psalmist put it at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1, 2</a>: “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help that is readily to be found during distresses.

Hezekiah could have felt that he was all alone, but he realized that God is “a help that is readily to be found during distresses.” So he prayed to Jehovah, and the city was delivered from its distress.

In order to make God our Refuge we must flee to him, and to do this we need ever to stick to his righteous principles.

<strong>Do You Know How to Endure Grief?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many persons have come to realize that they keep the emotional wound open if they try to live in a world of memories. Some persons do this by keeping a house for many years looking just as it was when their loved one was living. Those who prolong their grief in this manner vainly attempt to live in the past, instead of realizing that much happiness can be theirs if they will live for the future. The loved one a person has lost would have wanted the survivor to make the necessary adjustments <span id="page260" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="260" data-before-text="260"></span>so as to have a happy and productive life. It is wise to make those adjustments.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The bereaved person is certain to be keenly aware of the gap left by the loss of a loved one, but the painful feeling of loss can be lessened by trying to fill that gap with constructive activities. Unselfishly doing helpful things for other distressed people has proved successful with many people who have lost their mates. It has helped them to get their minds off themselves. Perhaps the greatest barrier to enduring grief is the tendency of a person to dwell upon what he personally lost by the death of his loved one. Thinking about how lonely he now is and the things he must now do that his loved one had done for him makes his grief difficult to bear. But, getting his mind off himself and on what he can do for other people, he will find that his emotional wound can heal and the gap in his life can gradually fill in. There is much a person can do to make his life worthwhile if he will think of others, having love for them as he would like them to have love for him.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The truths of God’s written Word are a great source of comfort for a bereaved person, giving him a purpose in life. They can remove the apprehension he might feel from not knowing what has become of his loved one. Through the Bible the Creator of life tells him what happens to a person who ceases to live and it tells him what the hope is for that person to have life once again.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Because of that wonderful hope, a Christian does not need to have the bitter sorrow experienced by those who do not know what the great Life-giver has said about the dead or who lack faith in him because of unbelief. This dependable information does much to lessen the pains of grief. “Moreover, brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant concerning those who are sleeping in death; that you may not sorrow just as the rest also do who have no hope.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963320/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:13</a>) Like the apostle Paul, he can put his trust in “God who raises up the dead.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963320/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:9</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">For those who have gained a knowledge of what Jehovah God has put into his written Word, the Holy Bible, for the benefit and comfort of mankind, the unselfish service of instructing others in God’s Word can be an important factor in helping them endure grief. This good spiritual activity can help fill the gap death has left in their lives. It will keep their minds occupied with unselfish and upbuilding activity. It will give them a substantial reason for carrying on.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Those who grieve can find strength in God by turning to him in prayer. No matter what anyone might say, God should not be blamed for the loss of a loved one. By learning from the Scriptures the reason for death and the hope for the dead to live again, a bereaved person has reason to express appreciation to him. This knowledge removes the terrifying and depressing feeling that there is no hope. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963320/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 46:1</a>) It helps immeasurably in the endurance of grief.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">With the hope that God’s Word gives, a bereaved person can more easily adjust his life so he can carry on without his loved one. He will be grateful that his loved one tasted life and that he was able to contribute to the happiness of it. He will be thankful that God has lovingly provided for the resurrection of the dead.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"></p>

Where physical persecution is involved, one’s own physical strength can soon run out.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The Christian’s strongest defense is his love for God and his complete reliance on Him.

God will give him strength beyond his own capacity in times of stress. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963406/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1, 2</a> promises: “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help that is readily to be found during distresses. That is why we shall not fear.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Continually meditate upon God and his purposes. Dwell on his Word in your mind, even though all Bibles and Bible literature are taken away from you. Keep the vision of God’s new world always before your eyes. Most important, “pray incessantly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963406/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:17</a>) This communication with God is indispensable, otherwise you might think only about the discomfort of the moment and give in to the inclinations of the flesh. If your heart is right, Jehovah will assist you to withstand this persecution, because “God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963406/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>PREPARE BEFORE PERSECUTION COMES</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">It is necessary to prepare in advance for persecution. It is good to think now about why persecution is permitted and what our course of action should be, so that when it comes we will be mentally prepared for it.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">We need to build up our faith, courage and integrity day by day. We will endure in proportion to our faith. Faith will be in proportion to our love of God, which, in turn, grows with knowledge. Strong conviction based on Bible reading, study, and association with other Christians is needed. In addition, we must live the truth. It must become part of our lives. In this way we will be put in the way of smaller tests day by day. As we overcome them we will be strengthened to endure the more severe ones that may come later. However, if we shrink back from doing God’s will in our daily lives now, then we will not be prepared to stand the more difficult tests later.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Learn all you can of God and his purposes now. Let that knowledge reach down into your heart and motivate your entire course of life. Remember, the person who knows God best will trust him the most in time of test.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">We have reached the time of the greatest crisis in the world’s history, a time of shaking and testing for God’s people. Shortly, Satan the Devil will make his final, all-out assault against Jehovah’s worshipers. With complete confidence and reliance on God, Christians will meet this brutal persecution and come off victorious. They will maintain integrity, to God’s honor and glory and to their own salvation. “Hope in Jehovah and keep his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked ones are cut off, you will see it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963406/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 37:34</a>) What grand encouragement this is for those who maintain integrity in the face of brutal persecution!</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"></p>

To rid the holy realms of heaven of their harmful influence war in heaven was necessary after God’s kingdom by Christ was set up there in 1914. The demons and their ruler have been hurled down to the earth, and what this was foretold to mean for earthlings has come true: “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 12:1-12</a>, <em>NW</em>) The Devil and his demons are responsible for the woe and turmoil on land and sea. There is no protection, stability and permanence under the demons, not even for their friends, servants and worshipers.

They could not do so at the time he loosed the global deluge against the world of violence in Noah’s day.

<strong>From World Distress into a Peaceful “New Earth”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> With the figurative “heavens” and “elements” and “earth and the works in it” undergoing destruction, it might appear to Jehovah’s worshipers who are caught within this world distress without equal that the whole universe is crashing about them. Yes, as though the very ground were moving out from beneath their feet. To the earthly spectators the course of events may take on a frightful aspect. It will become manifest that only by a miracle of the Almighty God can anyone in the flesh on earth possibly survive. Only by reposing full trust in the Universal Sovereign Jehovah will earthly beholders keep from letting terror grip their hearts. Reserved for such an unsettling experience as that is the temple psalm of the sons of Korah, who survived the fiery destruction of their rebellious father and his presumptuous fellow Levites:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help that <span id="page353" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="353" data-before-text="353"></span>is readily to be found during distresses. That is why we shall not fear, though the earth undergo change and though the mountains totter into the heart of the vast sea; though its waters be boisterous, foam over, though the mountains rock at its uproar. . . . There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, the holiest grand tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of the city; it will not be made to totter. God will help it at the appearance of morning. The nations became boisterous, the kingdoms tottered; He sounded with his voice, the earth proceeded to melt. Jehovah of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is a secure height for us.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975079/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1-7 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975079/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> superscription</a>.</p>

<strong>You Are Never Alone</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"><sup>32</sup></span> As a faithful Christian keep ever in mind that you are never alone. Jehovah God, moreover, is nearer than any enemy. And as the psalmist put it at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1, 2</a>: “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help that is readily to be found during distresses.

Hezekiah could have felt that he was all alone, but he realized that God is “a help that is readily to be found during distresses.” So he prayed to Jehovah, and the city was delivered from its distress. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Isa. 37:14-37</a>) Therefore, when true Christians are in distress, they too can keep this psalm in mind. In order to make God our Refuge we must flee to him, and to do this we need ever to stick to his righteous principles. By trusting in him, sticking faithfully to his organization, we make Jehovah our secure Tower and Refuge.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Prov. 18:10</a>.</p>

They will pray for his kingdom to come with destruction upon this worldly system of things, just as Jesus Christ taught us to pray in his Sermon on the Mount: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>) They will not run ahead of that coming of God’s kingdom and secretly set up a rebel government in exile and use violence to force people onto the side of God’s kingdom. They will peacefully follow the apostle’s instructions in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Romans 13:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 5</a>: “Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God. There is therefore compelling reason for you people to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath [expressed by these superior authorities] but also on account of your conscience.” True Christians know that they can never overthrow this worldly system of things.

The only way to do so is by studying God’s Word, the Holy Bible. It tells us convincingly who God is and what his kingdom means to us. Today disbelief in the God of the Bible is general, even in Christendom. Hence even to profess faith in this God calls for courage in the midst of a scoffing world. Furthermore, to believe that this God will set up his kingdom, not by means of world conversion through Christendom, but by direct action on God’s part with a world calamity, requires still more courage.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">49.

So it is absolutely necessary for us to get a Bible and study it and learn its heartening promises and believe them. We need to pray to this God who has made all these precious promises, assuring us that this world will be removed and God’s kingdom will be established and will bring in a righteous new world, along with the resurrection of the dead and the cultivating of a paradise earth-wide.</p>

Of course, the symbolic earth today is changing as from a political earthquake, and the land is roaring with the terrifying sounds of one earthquake shock after another accompanied by bloodcurdling howling of the people and dogs. Political governments which seemed like ancient mountains dominating and stabilizing the earth have been shaken to their roots and have toppled into the midst of the seas of peoples now in revolt against long-accepted political, commercial and religious systems and ideologies. The so-called “colored races” of the world have roused themselves and become agitated by winds of revolutionary doctrine and by earthquakes on the ocean floor. Fear of the “yellow peril”, which was already expressed in the last century, is now being revived. Especially so in the light of the tactics the yellow races are following in the Korean theater of war. Resorting to what they call <em>jen hai</em> or the “human sea”, they let loose tides of humans from their reservoir of hundreds of millions of people. By sheer force of numbers and brute strength they sweep along and overwhelm all military obstructions and barriers, regardless of the cheap human lives sacrificed. “Ah,” says God’s prophet, “the uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of <span id="page180" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="180" data-before-text="180"></span>nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!

<strong>Jehovah’s War of Armageddon</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jehovah’s “D-day” of Armageddon may be strictly a military secret, but the suddenness and surprise of it will convince even the enemy that this is it. Armageddon will break as suddenly as the flood that deluged the earth in Noah’s day; as suddenly as the bolts of fire that came down from heaven and licked up the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah in Lot’s day.

Crowned as Ruler of the new world, with flaming vengeance streaking from his eyes as he rides to victory upon a white war mount, Jehovah’s Vindicator will tread “the press of the wine of the anger of the wrath of God the Almighty”.

Whether atomic energy in some form will be released in that battle is not certain, but the Creator of the atom, if He chooses to do so, will certainly convince proud and haughty men of science that their A-bombs and planned H-bombs are mere firecrackers in His sight.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Joel 3:15, 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Hab. 3:1-19</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Just think of it, the greatest earthquake of the twentieth century, the one that struck Assam and northern India in 1950, was equivalent to the simultaneous explosion of 1,100,000 atomic bombs, each equal to 20,000 tons of TNT, and yet no one over a few hundred miles away felt the earth tremble beneath their feet.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21, 22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 37-39</a>) The very foundation of this troubled system of things will be moved from under it and plunged, as it were, into the dark depths of the oceans. It will be as if the very ground were being moved from beneath men. But God’s kingdom will never be moved or removed; and as long as we seek it first and anchor our hope in it, we can have the confidence that we find expressed in prophetic <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 46, verses 1 through 7</a>:</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" data-rel-pid="[95]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="46"><sup>46</sup></span> “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help that is readily to be found during distresses.

There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, the holiest grand tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of the city; it will not be made to totter. God will help it at the appearance of morning. The nations became boisterous, the kingdoms tottered; he sounded with his voice, the earth proceeded to melt.

They will pray for his kingdom to come with destruction upon this worldly system of things, just as Jesus Christ taught us to pray in his Sermon on the Mount: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>) They will not run ahead of that coming of God’s kingdom and secretly set up a rebel government in exile and use violence to force people onto the side of God’s kingdom. They will peacefully follow the apostle’s instructions in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Romans 13:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 5</a>: “Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God. There is therefore compelling reason for you people to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath [expressed by these superior authorities] but also on account of your conscience.” True Christians know that they can never overthrow this worldly system of things. They know that God’s time is at hand to do it.</p><p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="qu">48.

The only way to do so is by studying God’s Word, the Holy Bible. It tells us convincingly who God is and what his kingdom means to us. Today disbelief in the God of the Bible is general, even in Christendom. Hence even to profess faith in this God calls for courage in the midst of a scoffing world. Furthermore, to believe that this God will set up his kingdom, not by means of world conversion through Christendom, but by direct action on God’s part with a world calamity, requires still more courage.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">49. What do we have to do about the Bible and what it promises?</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" data-rel-pid="[98]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="49"><sup>49</sup></span> But how can we seek this God who is a shelter for us unless we learn about him? How can we seek first his kingdom if we <span id="page624" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="624" data-before-text="624"></span>keep in ignorance of it and its vital importance to us? So it is absolutely necessary for us to get a Bible and study it and learn its heartening promises and believe them. We need to pray to this God who has made all these precious promises, assuring us that this world will be removed and God’s kingdom will be established and will bring in a righteous new world, along with the resurrection of the dead and the cultivating of a paradise earth-wide.</p>

Of course, the symbolic earth today is changing as from a political earthquake, and the land is roaring with the terrifying sounds of one earthquake shock after another accompanied by bloodcurdling howling of the people and dogs. Political governments which seemed like ancient mountains dominating and stabilizing the earth have been shaken to their roots and have toppled into the midst of the seas of peoples now in revolt against long-accepted political, commercial and religious systems and ideologies. The so-called “colored races” of the world have roused themselves and become agitated by winds of revolutionary doctrine and by earthquakes on the ocean floor. Fear of the “yellow peril”, which was already expressed in the last century, is now being revived. Especially so in the light of the tactics the yellow races are following in the Korean theater of war. Resorting to what they call <em>jen hai</em> or the “human sea”, they let loose tides of humans from their reservoir of hundreds of millions of people. By sheer force of numbers and brute strength they sweep along and overwhelm all military obstructions and barriers, regardless of the cheap human lives sacrificed. “Ah,” says God’s prophet, “the uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of <span id="page180" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="180" data-before-text="180"></span>nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!

Crowned as Ruler of the new world, with flaming vengeance streaking from his eyes as he rides to victory upon a white war mount, Jehovah’s Vindicator will tread “the press of the wine of the anger of the wrath of God the Almighty”.

Whether atomic energy in some form will be released in that battle is not certain, but the Creator of the atom, if He chooses to do so, will certainly convince proud and haughty men of science that their A-bombs and planned H-bombs are mere firecrackers in His sight.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Joel 3:15, 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Hab. 3:1-19</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Just think of it, the greatest earthquake of the twentieth century, the one that struck Assam and northern India in 1950, was equivalent to the simultaneous explosion of 1,100,000 atomic bombs, each equal to 20,000 tons of TNT, and yet no one over a few hundred miles away felt the earth tremble beneath their feet.

<strong>Is the World Bloodguilty Before God?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Those who claim to serve God and who at the same time go to these worldly sources for waters of life are like the apostate Israelites who preferred to drink <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>from the Nile River along which Egypt was located and from the Euphrates River along which Assyria was situated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer. 2:17-19</a>) Those Jews “rejected the waters of the Shiloah that are going gently,” which waters correspond with the “river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, the holiest grand tabernacle of the Most High.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 8:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ps. 46:4</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Besides the false doctrines and the theories and teachings of philosophy and ideas from human, earthly origins, these worldly “rivers” and “fountains” have gushed forth programs, plans and arrangements for solving mankind’s problems. By drinking from these the people have been led into an activity contrary to God’s Word and have come under the condemnation of his laws. Some have not willfully and deliberately done so, but share community responsibility for supporting the spilling of blood in wars. They have been led to use blood wrongly in other ways, some by drinking it, others by transfusions and variously misusing it. They have had and are having opportunity to know God’s requirements, for they have heard the good news of God’s kingdom established in the heavens preached since 1919 by Jehovah’s witnesses. If they listen and repent of this course they can get forgiveness and life-giving waters from God. But the clergy of Christendom, Jewry and pagandom have united in supporting and advocating misuse of blood. At the same time they have ignored Jehovah, the great Fountain of life, his provision through Christ’s ransom and his Messianic kingdom for imparting life to believing, obedient mankind. Moreover, they have rejected and opposed the good news, thereby blocking others from hearing, bringing bloodguilt upon them in this way.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>WHY WATERS BECOME BLOOD</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">John hears the angel’s expression of gratification over the work done: “And I heard the angel over the waters say: ‘You, the One who is and who was, the loyal One, are righteous, because you have rendered these decisions, because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve it.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 16:5, 6</a>) So God is entirely just in dealing with them in this way. Those drinking from the contaminated worldly sources have been led into fighting against God’s holy ones and prophets, Jehovah’s Christian witnesses. Especially have they been egged on to do so by Babylon the Great, the false religious empire over the peoples of earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 17:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 18</a>) Jehovah cannot approve of their blood-spilling course of action. He is loyal to his faithful witnesses and is righteous in executing his judicial decision upon those who violently pour out the blood of his servants. God judges them this way only after they show themselves unworthy of life and fully deserving of letting their drink be blood, which means that their punishment is death.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Now an unexpected and amazing thing happens: “And I heard the altar say: ‘Yes, Jehovah God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judicial decisions.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 16:7</a>) What is the “altar”? The altar in the tent of meeting in Israel was God’s arrangement upon which sacrifices were to be offered to him. The “altar” is God’s symbolic altar-like arrangement for Jesus’ sacrifice. God provided his Son as a sacrifice, arranged for him to come to earth as a man, die here, be resurrected and appear in heaven with the value of his sacrifice to buy life rights for sinful mankind. Such arrangement was undeserved kindness on God’s part. Faithful footstep followers of Jesus Christ, his spiritual brothers, have followed closely in <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>his steps. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21</a>) All of them die his kind of death, that is, as a sacrifice, not that their shed blood has any part in sin atonement, but that they might experience Jesus’ kind of resurrection. Many have been literally martyred by those who drink from the fountains and water sources of this world.</p>

<strong>Early Help for Surviving the World’s End</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> One city, though, is enjoying a refreshment and a gladness that the world does not know and cannot understand. It is the new world city toward which the true Christians have been traveling for the past nineteen centuries, God’s capital of the universe. Now it has established its power over our earth. This is the city which the apostle means when he writes: “But you have approached a mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels, in general assembly, and the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens, and <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>God the Judge of all, and the spiritual lives of righteous ones who have been made perfect, and Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling which speaks in a better way than Abel’s blood.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 12:22-24</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jerusalem on earth was once the symbol of the heavenly Jerusalem, in the days when faithful kings of the lineage of David sat on the “throne of Jehovah” on one of its mountains called “Mount Zion”. By establishing his temple there God placed his name Jehovah at that city, and so the city foreshadowed God’s capital organization of the universe. Christ Jesus and his faithful congregation of joint heirs glorified make up that capital organization.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 3. Why, then, is there unity among the widespread witnesses of Jehovah, and also unusual gladness?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> In 1914 Christ Jesus, the Chief Son in God’s organization, was enthroned and thus brought forth to active Kingdom authority. He reigns at his heavenly Father’s right hand, and the ancient prophecy addressed to him now applies: “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>) So now there is unusual gladness in the heavenly Zion. It is no wonder, then, that Jehovah’s witnesses on earth who represent his kingdom are also glad. They may be spread all over the earth for the purpose of giving a pre-Armageddon witness before the world ends, but they are bound together in unbreakable unity by a theocratic organization under the King Christ Jesus. It matters not that they are in the midst of their enemies. They know their King is now ruling in the midst of these enemies and will shortly dash them to pieces like striking a potter’s vessels with an iron rod. They do not mourn over the end of this world which the handwriting on the wall announces to the nations. They rejoice with the holy hosts of heaven over the bringing of God’s kingdom to birth to rule the righteous new world. So the source of their joy and gladness is a secret to this world, and it makes all the nations marvel that no world woe dries it up.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 4. What does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 46:4</a> disclose to be the source of their irrepressible gladness?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The psalmist discloses the source of the irrepressible gladness of Jehovah’s witnesses: “There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 46:4</a>, <em>AS</em>) This river is vital to the life of the visible organization of God’s people, for it means life-giving refreshment to them. It is a river of divine blessings to them, a river of truths about his kingdom long ago promised and now set up. Along with this river goes the joyful privilege of spreading its Kingdom truths to all who seek good government, security and lasting peace. Today the American nation is facing a serious shortage in its water resources. The latest Water Resources Report reveals there are serious wastes in the nation’s precious water supply. In the face of increasing water needs it constitutes a national peril. However, Jehovah’s witnesses are not wasting the precious waters of Kingdom truth and are not wasting the precious opportunities of reviving the spiritually parched people of good will. Forth from the throne of God and of his reigning King at his right hand the life-giving river of truth flows, in fulfillment of the vision given to the apostle John, who described it in these words: “And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of its broad way. And on this side of the river and on that side there were trees of life producing twelve crops of fruits, yielding their fruits each month. And the leaves of the trees were for the curing of the nations.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 22:1, 2</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

They will peacefully follow the apostle’s instructions in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Romans 13:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962761/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 5</a>: “Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God. There is therefore compelling reason for you people to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath [expressed by these superior authorities] but also on account of your conscience.” True Christians know that they can never overthrow this worldly system of things.

The only way to do so is by studying God’s Word, the Holy Bible. It tells us convincingly who God is and what his kingdom means to us. Today disbelief in the God of the Bible is general, even in Christendom. Hence even to profess faith in this God calls for courage in the midst of a scoffing world. Furthermore, to believe that this God will set up his kingdom, not by means of world conversion through Christendom, but by direct action on God’s part with a world calamity, requires still more courage.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">49.

So it is absolutely necessary for us to get a Bible and study it and learn its heartening promises and believe them. We need to pray to this God who has made all these precious promises, assuring us that this world will be removed and God’s kingdom will be established and will bring in a righteous new world, along with the resurrection of the dead and the cultivating of a paradise earth-wide.</p>

<strong>Early Help for Surviving the World’s End</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Christ Jesus proves he is ruling in the midst of his enemies by safeguarding the river of Bible truths at its source in heaven. His ruling power keeps it continually flowing to his faithful sheep on earth in the theocratic organization. You do not see the present-day Jewish-Arab city of Jerusalem made glad by these waters of this divine river, nor Vatican City nor any other of the world capitals. These refuse such waters but rejoice in conspiracies and alliances for digging wells to receive and retain the waters of human philosophy, social ideologies and religious traditions. The witnesses of Jehovah are the ones <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>made glad by the river of truth. They constitute the visible organization that now increases its gladness by drinking from the never-failing streams of this river of truth from God’s Word. Vatican City and other totalitarian world capitals would like to cut off these waters and create a water famine among them and force them to forsake the theocratic organization. They attempt to do this by putting Jehovah’s witnesses under ban and by dissolving branches of the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society with which they co-operate and then forbidding the Watch Tower publications to be imported, exported and circulated.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8. Why cannot such measures really stop the water’s flow?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Let such totalitarian foes of God’s kingdom ban and dissolve the legal organization and seize its properties. They cannot stop consecrated Christian individuals from acting as Jehovah’s mouthpieces by preaching with just the Bible alone, or even without it if deprived of it and limited to the knowledge of God’s Word in their hearts. Let them arrest these faithful Christians and hold them bound in prison. The Word of God Jehovah is not bound as long as their mouths are unsealed among fellow prisoners and exiles. Jesus said: “He that puts faith in me, just as the Scripture has said, ‘Out from his inmost part streams of living water will flow.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 7:38, 39</a>, <em>NW</em>) God’s spirit upon his consecrated witnesses makes it that way. And let the enemies know too that there are underground rivers and that the course of the waters of Shiloah was covered over and flowed underground and via tunnel into the midst of the city of God. Just so, if need be, the river of Kingdom truth can flow by underground movement. Unnoticed by the King’s enemies, it reaches those who are thirsting for the refreshing waters from the Bible. Hence it is that the “river of water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb”, continues on its irresistible course and the prophecy is fulfilled: “The spirit and the bride keep on saying, ‘Come!’ And let anyone hearing say, ‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 22:17</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. What does calling the city of God “the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High” mean for it?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The city of God, gladdened by the streams of his Kingdom river, is declared to be “the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High”. That means that the Supreme One of the universe dwells there and has sanctified the place with his holy presence. He has put his name upon the people in that theocratic organization. His temple is there, which means that his pure worship is carried on there by his devoted witnesses. His worship is a safety to them, safeguarding them against all the false ways and policies into which the religions of this world are leading the people. Since he has sanctified the organization with his presence and name, he is determined to keep it clean and pure. No wonder that the enemies who touch his theocratic organization with evil intent are as if touching the tender pupil of his eye. They will suffer for it. No creature, demon or human, will destroy His clean organization. It is a permanent thing. The Most High God will fulfill his promise to preserve the faithful ones within it. Therefore the psalmist rightly says: “God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God will help her, and that right early.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 46:5</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10. What does the divine presence produce in those in the organization? So in what structure is their trust?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> The divine presence in the midst of the organization produces a sense of security among those in it. They know it is the right organization to stay united with, for <span id="page185" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="185" data-before-text="185"></span>it will never be moved and made to totter, stagger and fall to ruin. This does not mean that material buildings occupied and used by members of the organization may not be seized, invaded, expropriated and destroyed by the foe. Remember that “the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; just as the prophet says: ‘The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? Jehovah says.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 7:48, 49</a>, <em>NW</em>) But the Most High does dwell in his theocratic organization, whether its members on earth are housed or not. So our trust is not even in buildings devoted to his service. It is his theocratic organization, therefore, that will never be moved by enemy assaults and caused to collapse, for God’s presence within it makes it permanent though all the world round about it ends. “Trust ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jehovah, even Jehovah, is an everlasting rock.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 26:4</a>, <em>AS</em>) Founded on this rock, his theocratic organization will last forever. So those who trust in him will last forever, because they take him at his word and seek refuge with his organization.</p>

It was “when the morning arose” that the angels hurried Lot and his wife and daughters out of Sodom to escape the deluge of fire and sulphur upon the corrupt city. When the Egyptian forces were driving through the Red sea after the fleeing Israelites, it was at the morning watch or watch of daybreak that Jehovah looked through the pillar of fire and the cloud and began troubling the pursuers. Finally he collapsed the walls of sea water in upon them, “when the morning appeared.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. <span id="page186" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="186" data-before-text="186"></span>19:15-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ex. 14:24-31</a>) It was “early in the morning” that the people of Jerusalem rose according to the arrangement of King Jehoshaphat and they marched forth singing Jehovah’s praises; and when this singing began Jehovah confused the united armies of Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir and caused them to annihilate one another. When the Assyrian hordes under the Assyrian conqueror Sennacherib menaced the life and independence of Jerusalem, Jehovah’s angel stole through the night and killed 185,000 in the invading army. When King Hezekiah and his besieged people rose “early in the morning”, it was to learn that all those thousands of the enemy had been mowed down and the aggressor was in disgraceful retreat back to Assyria.

Actually it is against Jehovah’s kingdom and against his ambassadors on earth, Jehovah’s witnesses, that the nations are raging. They are now militarized as never before over the supreme issue of world domination. Their determination is either to divide domination between two national blocs of opposed ideologies or to have one bloc as victor hog the whole domination. There is no idea of letting God have it as the Creator and Universal Sovereign. They have their own charter of the United Nations; they have their own treaties of alliance within the framework of the United Nations. They have no regard for the unchangeable covenant which God made with his Son Jesus Christ for the absolute government of the righteous new world. So prayers by their religious clergy for His kingdom are sheer hypocrisy and are for God to adopt the political governments of selfish, ambitious men as his kingdom. By their own militarization and the emergency measures which they take the nations are pressed into opposing the good news of God’s kingdom which his witnesses proclaim world-wide.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16.

The political beast of world domination and the false-prophet system which made such deceptive political predictions will be pitched alive into destruction symbolized by the fiery lake burning with sulphur. No political machine will hold, no ideological group will keep together, no international compact will have any strength, no United Nations or mutual defense alliance will prove binding.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 17:1-18</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19, 20.

His hosts or armies are not imaginary “men from Mars” invading our earth, but are mighty angels like the one with whom he wiped out all the flower of Egypt, her firstborn of man and beast; and like the angel who dealt stealthy death to 185,000 of Sennacherib’s slumbering camp. Jehovah’s beloved Son Jesus Christ is prophetically called “Immanuel”, and his name means “With us is God” or “God is on our side”. In symbol that God is with us, his Immanuel is with us, which means that the “prince of the host of Jehovah” is with us, with all that host.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Josh. 5:14</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> He now has at his disposal those twelve legions of angels, for the aid of which he refused to call on the night of his betrayal in Gethsemane.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978242/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21</a>) It will result in something that no SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) or disarmament conferences have even <em>started</em> to accomplish​—the complete disarming of the nations. We are invited to a preview of these world-shaking happenings: “Come, you people, behold the activities of Jehovah, how he has set astonishing events on the earth. He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the [war] wagons he burns in the fire.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978242/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">There is purpose behind this decisive action by the Almighty God, Jehovah. The nations have proved over the centuries and are still showing that they cannot bring stable peace and security to the peoples of earth. They have been given every opportunity and they have tried every kind of government. However, all of them have built their house on a wrong foundation. In rivalry toward one another, they now pile their nuclear and other armaments higher and higher, vying with one another as they seek to maintain some kind of shaky balance of power. No wonder that the Almighty God, Jehovah, purposes to wipe out such an insecure and murderous arrangement.</p>

<strong>The Great God Who Is “Doing Wondrous Things”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> ‘With all his heart’ David could declare: “There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah, neither are there any works like yours.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 86:8</a>) In David’s day, as today, the earth was <span id="page38" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>filled with a multitude of gods. Though Buddha, Brahma, Confucius and Christendom’s triune “God” had not yet appeared to add confusion to the religious scene, there were a host of gods to be worshiped in the religions of Philistia, Assyria, Babylon and other nations surrounding Israel. As they went out to war, these nations carried images of their gods on staves, from which also fluttered their national pendants. Some of these gods, such as Molech of Ammon and Chemosh of Moab, were known as “fire gods,” and exacted human sacrifices. Baal of Peor was worshiped with lewd sex rites. David not only maintained separateness from this cruel, immoral world of confused religionists, but he removed their contaminating influence by driving them right out from the God-given land of Israel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 11:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5.

The gods of worldly nations had left no such record; indeed, they had accomplished nothing worthy of praise or record. It is Jehovah alone, “the grand King” and who is “great and very much to be praised,” that has caused to be written down the record of his wondrous works and eternal purposes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>) David exulted, not only in the divine promise of an everlasting Kingdom, but in all the other glorious prophecies looking down to our day.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

It is the day to which David looked forward with joy. It is the day in which prophecy upon prophecy is coming to grand fulfillment. In the modern year of 1914 Jehovah established the everlasting kingdom of heaven in the hands of one greater than David, his Son Jesus Christ. In 1919 he brought forth on this earth a New World society to preach “this good news of the kingdom . . . for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) As the nucleus of this New World society, the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses serve “as signs and as wonders,” to be seen by all men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 8:18</a>) And now, in their hundreds of thousands, men of good will, “the precious things of all nations,” are flocking to the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, for they see in it a peace and joy that contrast sharply with the old world’s divisions and hatreds.

<strong>The Folly of War</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Had Zhukov shattered the theory of the atomic standoff? There were conflicting opinions. But many Western observers have long expressed little faith in such a theory. Senator Stuart Symington, former United States Air Force secretary, phrased it this way: “One of the dreams that lulls us into this hopeful make-believe is the theory of the so-called atomic standoff. This is the argument that, when both we and the Communists have plenty of atomic weapons, neither of us will use them. To gamble on such a miracle is like betting that two men armed with loaded pistols will merely wrestle until one of them is thrown to the ground and kicked to death. <span id="page612" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="612" data-before-text="612"></span>. . . Nations, like men, know that terrible weapons can mean sudden death; but neither nations nor men have ever refrained from using their decisive weapons in a life-or-death fight.”—<em>U.S. News &amp; World Report,</em> July 30, 1954.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">War is folly as never before; yet there is no sure guarantee that leaders will not plunge their countries into war. How strange a time we live in! It is really unique. But this uniqueness goes back to a time before the invention of the atomic bomb. That observer of politics and history, Elmer Davis, writing in his book <em>Two Minutes Till Midnight,</em> shows that this unique period goes back to 1914:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“A Rip van Winkle who had gone to sleep in the early summer of 1914 and woke up now would feel that he had emerged into a world of barbarism—a sophisticated and streamlined barbarism, of high technical competence, but barbarism none the less by contrast with the world he had known. There were tyrannies then, but very feeble and ineffective beside the tyrannies of today; and even before the fission or fusion bombs were invented, the free world had condoned methods of war-making which until August 1914 had seemed forever abandoned as unworthy of civilized man. But the code then existing was shattered by the Germans—not the nihilistic Nazis, but the respectable Christian Germans of the Kaiserreich; and once they had done what they thought might help them win, their opponents imitated them—as they always will.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We entered this “world of barbarism” in 1914. That year indeed marked a turning point in the affairs of men. The outbreak of World War I that year was itself significant, for Christ Jesus, the great Prophet, foretold world war to mark the beginning of the “last days.” “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,” he said in his long-range prophecy, “and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957760/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The “pangs of distress” that have convulsed this world since 1914 mean good news to those who know their significance. They mean that God’s heavenly kingdom will soon destroy this wicked, warring world and bring permanent peace to the earth. True, the situation from a human standpoint appears hopeless. Jesus said it was certain to be that way, that there would be “on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation, while men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957760/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Even now that we have come into this time when war is so catastrophic a folly, men do not know the way out. They are far from certain that the incredible folly of atomic war will prevent another world war. How vital, then, for true Christians to put their trust, not in men, but in God! He is the One who has promised that during this unique period in history he will ruin those ruining the earth: “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time . . . to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957760/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 11:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">War is folly. It is folly also to trust in man to bring in permanent peace. God himself will do it. There will be no wars after Jehovah’s righteous war of Armageddon—no wars, not even wars with stone clubs. Jehovah’s promise is: “Come, behold the works of Jehovah, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957760/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

Yet we know they surround us with their protection. “The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 34:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) We know that at present they are “spirits for public service” whom God sends forth to minister to his Kingdom heirs and their companions of good will.

He bestowed the birthright to the great Abrahamic promise upon Jacob and changed his name to Israel. We may be sure that he loves his spiritual Israel today, those who are Israelites inwardly by faith in Jehovah and in his promised Seed Jesus Christ. And now their good-will companions are beloved with them. Having the God of Jacob as our lofty retreat, there is no need for us to organize refuge farms in isolated places, retire to ourselves there and quit the field of activity as Kingdom publishers. Trust in the great God of Jacob is not demonstrated by hiding in seclusion but is demonstrated by courageously going forth onto the field of action and spreading his message of life. “Jehovah preserveth the faithful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 31:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) Retreating into him as our high tower means to keep in unity with him wherever we may be in the line of duty. That way we stay inside the organization of his theocratic people who are scattered all over the earth. By carrying out organization instructions as contained in God’s Word, we work like our fellow witnesses everywhere else. Unitedly we publish the name and government of Jehovah, bidding all life-seekers to take refuge under Him.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">22.

It takes the viewpoint of a survivor after the world calamity of Armageddon: “Come view the doings of Jehovah, who hath set desolations in the earth: causing wars to cease unto the end of the earth, the bow he breaketh and cutteth asunder the spear, waggons he burneth with fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9</a>, <em>Ro. Pss</em>.) This invitation, uttered by those within the visible organization of Jehovah God, positively assures us there will be survivors on earth after Armageddon will have swept away this old world with the broom of destruction and cleansed the earth for the righteous new world. The survivors will be informed and will know it is Jehovah by his mighty Warrior Jesus Christ who has set the then visible desolations in the earth. Such desolations will not have destroyed the earth or ruined it beyond restoration to a paradise state like the garden of Eden. They will only have ‘brought to ruin those ruining the earth’. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) God will not destroy his footstool, the earth, but will glorify it under the kingdom of his Christ. Thus it is Jehovah by Christ who ends all forms of war on the earth by destroying all the warmongers, ‘scattering the peoples that delight in war’ and demolishing their terrible weapons of war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 68:30</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">23.

Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.” After decades of testimony we may not now expect political and religious rulers to appreciate and follow this advice and learn to know that Jehovah is God in a way that means salvation to them. But we may look for individuals of all nations to desist from all acts against Jehovah and his theocratic organization and to give in, be still and learn to know him and do good to Christ’s brothers. This means everlasting life.</p>

<strong>Can I Find Words of Comfort in the Bible?</strong><br/><p id="p51" data-pid="51"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> God’s Kingdom will soon eliminate all war.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/738/0"><em>Insight,</em> Volume 1<em>,</em> p. 668</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Earth</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Bible writers often speak from the standpoint of the observer on the earth, or from his particular position geographically, as we often naturally do today. For example, the Bible mentions “the sunrising.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Nu 2:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 34:15</a>) Some have seized upon this as an opportunity to discredit the Bible as scientifically inaccurate, claiming that the Hebrews viewed earth as the center of things, with the sun revolving around it. But the Bible writers nowhere expressed such a belief. These same critics overlook the fact that they themselves use the identical expression and that it is in all of their almanacs. It is common to hear someone say, ‘it is sunrise,’ or ‘the sun has set,’ or ‘the sun traveled across the sky.’ The Bible also speaks of “the extremity of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 46:9</a>), “the ends of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps 22:27</a>), “the four extremities of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isa 11:12</a>), “the four corners of the earth,” and “the four winds of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Re 7:1</a>). These expressions cannot be taken to prove that the Hebrews understood the earth to be square. The number four is often used to denote that which is fully rounded out, as it were, just as we have four directions and sometimes employ the expressions “to the ends of the earth,” “to the four corners of the earth,” in the sense of embracing all the earth.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Eze 1:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Lu 13:29</a>.</p>

<strong>Wagon</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Israel, especially in earlier times, the wagon was usually drawn by cattle rather than horses, the latter being used especially for chariots and in warfare.

<strong>War</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">With the conclusion of this war, the earth will enjoy peace for a thousand years. The psalm that declares “[Jehovah] is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the wagons he burns in the fire,” had initial fulfillment in God’s bringing peace to Israel’s land by wrecking the enemy’s war instruments. After Christ defeats the promoters of war at Har–Magedon, the extremity of this earthly globe will enjoy full and satisfying peace. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ps 46:8-10</a>) Persons favored with eternal life will be those who have beaten “their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears” and who do not “learn war anymore.” “For the very mouth of Jehovah of armies has spoken it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Isa 2:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/59/1" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> Mic 4:3, 4</a>.</p>

<strong>An End to War</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible explains at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004001/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 46:9</a> that real peace requires an end of war, not in just one region of the globe, but in all the earth. Furthermore, this same psalm specifically mentions the destruction of the weapons of Bible times​—the bow and the spear. The weapons that proliferate nowadays must likewise be destroyed if mankind is ever to live in peace.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/742/0">4/15/1990, p. 5</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>World Peace—What Will It Really Mean?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990281/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 46:8, 9</a> says: “Come, you people, behold the activities of Jehovah, how he has set astonishing events on the earth. He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the wagons he burns in the fire.” The words “bow,” “spear,” and ‘wagon,’ are symbols of any sort of war weapon or war machinery. Jehovah thus goes far beyond arms limitation or even total disarmament. He thoroughly eliminates nuclear weapons, cannons, tanks, missile launchers, grenades, plastic explosives, rifles, handguns​—<em>anything</em> that could threaten global peace!</p>

<strong>Armageddon—A War That Leads to True Peace</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span><strong>Peace​—By Eliminating the Means to Wage War</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">One of the reasons that the nations have not been able to do away with war is that they have not been able to do away with the means to wage war. Even though they know that the spiraling arms buildup is suicidal, they are not willing to give it up or to slow it down. It will be “astonishing,” indeed, when Jehovah takes action and accomplishes what the nations cannot do: “The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the wagons he burns in the fire.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985121/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 46:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah has in the past demonstrated his ability to neutralize the most advanced or formidable weapons that the nations could brandish. For example, he delivered his seemingly defenseless people, the Israelites, from the military might of the first world power, Egypt, by wielding the elemental forces of the waters of the Red Sea. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985121/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 15:3-5</a>) Similarly, Canaanite King Jabin’s sophisticated tactical weapons, “nine hundred war chariots with iron scythes,” in the command of his army chief Sisera, were rendered totally inoperative when Jehovah unleashed the powers of a flash flood. The enemy ranks were thrown into total confusion, leading to their liquidation down to the last man. The outcome was that “the land had no further disturbance for forty years.”​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985121/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Judges, chapter 4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985121/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985121/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Significantly, that decisive battle against King Jabin’s forces took place in the torrent valley of Kishon, “by the waters of Megiddo.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985121/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Judges 5:19-21</a>) It therefore provides us with a dramatic preview of Jehovah’s total victory in the forthcoming battle of Armageddon.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What “mysterious” forces, if any, Jehovah will use against his enemies we do not know. What we do know is that he does have at his disposal forces that can completely devastate the military establishments of the nations. Scientists are aware, for example, that a powerful electromagnetic pulse​—something even they can generate by a high-altitude nuclear explosion—​is capable of knocking out the communication and military control systems of a nation, thus throwing everything into chaos. Reasonably, Jehovah will <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>nullify all the nations’ arsenals in order to lay the foundation for total peace.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1200020019/443/2"> w83 11/15 12;</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>“He Is Making Wars to Cease”</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">However, we have to face the fact that lasting peace for all mankind will never come by human efforts alone. Something much greater is needed​—not just an international government, as many have advocated—​but a supranational government, above all petty politics and nationalism. God’s heavenly government through Christ is just that.

Then would you expect the Almighty God to do any less under his rule? No, for he assures us that he “is making wars to cease <em>to the extremity of the earth.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979002/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 46:9</a>) That means worldwide security for the first time in history, unlike today where any peace or security is only temporary, since wars, riots, insurrections and the like are going on somewhere nearly all the time.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">God’s Kingdom government will not only enforce earth-wide peace.

<strong>The Way Peace Can Come to Earth</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The Prince of Peace, God’s king of all the earth, will bring an end to national conflicts. Just as God did in protecting his people Israel in ancient times, so he, through his appointed King, will do earth wide, and permanently. The 46th Psalm, recounting God’s protection of Jerusalem from enemy nations round about, provides an example of what he will do in behalf of all peaceable ones. It states: “Jehovah of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is a secure height for us. . . . Come, you people, behold the activities of Jehovah, how he has set astonishing events on the earth. He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the wagons [for battle use] he burns in the fire.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979883/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 46:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">With peace and harmony on the earth, works benefiting the earth can be carried out without hindrance, community wealth will not be drained for war purposes and the entire emphasis will be on beneficial projects. The rich produce of the earth will not be wasted. As to the individual, he can develop his talents and abilities and contribute freely to the general welfare of others. Only through a peace established with God can true world peace be brought about and maintained. Such a state of harmony between God and man is described in these words of the 85th Psalm: “As for loving-kindness and trueness, they have met each other; righteousness and peace​—they have kissed each other. Trueness itself will sprout out of the very earth, and righteousness itself will look down from the very heavens. Also, Jehovah, for his part, will give what is good, and our own land will give its yield.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979883/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 85:10-12</a>.</p>

<strong>Earth</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>, speaks of God as “hanging the earth upon nothing.” Science says that the earth remains in its orbit in space primarily due to the interaction of gravity and centrifugal force. These forces, of course, are invisible. Therefore the earth, as other heavenly bodies, is suspended in space as if hanging on nothing. Speaking from Jehovah’s viewpoint, the prophet Isaiah says: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22</a>) The Bible says: “He [God] has described a circle upon the face of the waters.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 26:10</a>) The waters are limited by his decree to their proper place. They do not come up and inundate the land; neither do they fly off into space. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>) From the viewpoint of Jehovah, the earth’s face, or the surface of the waters, would, of course, have a circular form, <span id="page477" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="477" data-before-text="477"></span>just as the edge of the moon presents a circular appearance to us. Before land surfaces appeared, the surface of the entire globe was one circular (spherical) mass of surging waters.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Gen. 1:2</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Bible writers often speak from the standpoint of the observer on the earth, or from his particular position geographically, as we often naturally do today. For example, the Bible mentions the “sunrising.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Num. 2:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 34:15</a>) Some have seized upon this as an opportunity to discredit the Bible as scientifically inaccurate, claiming that the Hebrews viewed earth as the center of things, with the sun revolving around it. But the Bible writers nowhere expressed such a belief. These same critics overlook the fact that they themselves use the identical expression and that it is in all their almanacs. It is common to hear someone say, “it is sunrise,” or “the sun has set,” or “the sun traveled across the sky.” The Bible also speaks of “the extremity of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps. 46:9</a>), “the ends of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps. 22:27</a>), “the four extremities of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isa. 11:12</a>), “the four corners of the earth” and “the four winds of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Rev. 7:1</a>) These expressions cannot be taken to prove that the Hebrews understood the earth to be square. The number four is often used to denote that which is fully rounded out, as it were, just as we have four directions an] sometimes employ the expressions “to the ends of the earth,” “to the four quarters of the earth” in the sense of embracing all the earth.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ezekiel 1:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Luke 13:29</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The Bible describes the earth as having an expanse or firmament, an atmosphere, and indicates that prior to the Flood there was a heavy canopy of water vapor above the expanse.

The apostle Peter therefore describes the situation as “an earth standing compactly out of water and in the midst of water.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:5</a>) It seems that, because of such an arrangement, the ground was watered by a mist rather than a direct rain.

Even frozen mammals of tropical habitat have been found in far-northern areas. McReady Price states the following in his book <em>The New Geology:</em> “There is but one climate known to the ancient fossil world, as revealed by the plants and animals entombed in the rocks; and that climate was a mantle of springlike loveliness which seems to have prevailed continuously over the whole globe. Just how the world could have been thus warmed all over may be a matter of conjecture; that it was so warmed effectively and continuously is a matter of fact.” And George Gamow, in his book <em>Biography of the Earth,</em> 1948, writes: “While the areas now covered by temperate vegetation were occupied by tropical jungles, such ordinary trees as oak, chestnut, and maple were growing in Alaska, Greenland, Spitsbergen, and Northern Asia. Finally, the typical boreal plants, such as dwarf birch and dwarf willow, were very common in regions which are so far north that no vegetation at all can grow there today. Data concerning the Southern Hemisphere are again rather meagre, but the finding of coal deposits in several places along the shore of Antarctica indisputably proves that there were times when this continent, at present almost completely glaciated, was covered by rich vegetation.” These facts would support the above-mentioned vapor-canopy arrangement, which could bring about the conditions Biblically described and scientifically discovered.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE AND SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The earth is spoken of figuratively in several instances.

Jehovah also uses a figurative expression describing the result of earth’s rotation.

In similar manner at the arrival of dawn, the portion of the earth coming from the blackness of night begins to show itself to have form and color as the sunlight moves progressively across its face.

The apostle explained that things such as the eating of meat or vegetables, the observing of certain days as above others, even the eating of meat that had been offered to idols before being put up for regular sale in the marketplaces, were matters of conscience. He wrote: “One man judges one day as above another; another man judges one day as all others; let each man be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day observes it to Jehovah. Also, he who eats, eats to Jehovah, for he gives thanks to God; and he who does not eat does not eat to Jehovah, and yet gives thanks to God.” Then he summed up his argument by stating the principle: “For the kingdom of God does not mean eating and drinking, but means righteousness and peace and joy with holy spirit,” and concluded: “Happy is the man that does not put himself on judgment by what he approves. But if he has doubts, he is already condemned if he eats, because he does not eat out of faith. Indeed, everything that is not out of faith is sin.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014463/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rom. 14:5, 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014463/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014463/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014463/33/3" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:25-30</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">An enlightening comment is made on this point by Bible scholar Albert Barnes, in his <em>Notes, Explanatory and Practical, on the Acts of the Apostles</em> (pp. 290, 291). Making reference to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014463/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Acts 21:20</a>, which reads: “After hearing this [an account of God’s blessing on Paul’s ministry to the nations] they began to glorify God, and they said to him: ‘You behold, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews; and they are all zealous for the Law,’” Barnes remarks: “The reference here is, to the law respecting circumcision, sacrifices, distinctions of meats and days, festivals, &amp;c. It may seem remarkable that they should still continue to observe those rites, since it was the manifest design of Christianity to abolish them. But we are to remember, (1.) That those rites had been appointed by God, and that they were trained to their observance. (2.) That the apostles conformed to them while they remained in Jerusalem, and did not deem it best to set themselves violently against them. ch. iii. 1. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014463/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Luke xxiv. 53</a>. (3.) That the question about their observance had never been agitated at Jerusalem. It was only among the Gentile converts that the question had risen, and there it <em>must</em> arise, for if they were to be observed, they must have been <em>imposed</em> upon them by authority. (4.) The decision of the council (ch. xv.) related only to the <em>Gentile</em> converts. [<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014463/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Acts 15:23</a>] . . . (5.) It was to be presumed, that as the Christian religion became better understood—that as its large, free, and [universal] nature became more and more developed, the peculiar institutions of Moses would be laid aside of course, without agitation, and without tumult. Had the question been agitated [publicly] at Jerusalem, it would have excited tenfold opposition to Christianity, and would have rent the Christian church into factions, and greatly retarded the advance of the Christian doctrine. We are to remember also, (6.) That, in the arrangement of Divine Providence, the time was drawing near which was to destroy the temple, the city, and the nation; which was to put an end to sacrifices, and <em>effectually</em> to close for ever the observance of the Mosaic rites. As this destruction was so near, and as it would be so effectual an <em>argument</em> against the observance of the Mosaic rites, the Great Head of the church did not suffer the question of their obligation to be needlessly agitated among the disciples at Jerusalem.”</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"></p>

<strong>“Happy the Peacemakers”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah God engages in war only to get rid of the peace disturbers so that peace can hold sway in his universe. Thus we read: “He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the [war] wagons he burns in the fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971650/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 46:9</a>) That is why he is described as “the God who gives peace,” and as the “God of peace.” Since he is also called “the happy God,” he, above all others, is the happy Peacemaker.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971650/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 15:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971650/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Phil. 4:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971650/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Thess. 5:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971650/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 1 Tim. 1:11</a>.</p>

<strong>The Folly of War</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Had Zhukov shattered the theory of the atomic standoff? There were conflicting opinions. But many Western observers have long expressed little faith in such a theory. Senator Stuart Symington, former United States Air Force secretary, phrased it this way: “One of the dreams that lulls us into this hopeful make-believe is the theory of the so-called atomic standoff. This is the argument that, when both we and the Communists have plenty of atomic weapons, neither of us will use them. To gamble on such a miracle is like betting that two men armed with loaded pistols will merely wrestle until one of them is thrown to the ground and kicked to death. <span id="page612" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="612" data-before-text="612"></span>. . . Nations, like men, know that terrible weapons can mean sudden death; but neither nations nor men have ever refrained from using their decisive weapons in a life-or-death fight.”—<em>U.S. News &amp; World Report,</em> July 30, 1954.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">War is folly as never before; yet there is no sure guarantee that leaders will not plunge their countries into war. How strange a time we live in! It is really unique. But this uniqueness goes back to a time before the invention of the atomic bomb. That observer of politics and history, Elmer Davis, writing in his book <em>Two Minutes Till Midnight,</em> shows that this unique period goes back to 1914:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“A Rip van Winkle who had gone to sleep in the early summer of 1914 and woke up now would feel that he had emerged into a world of barbarism—a sophisticated and streamlined barbarism, of high technical competence, but barbarism none the less by contrast with the world he had known. There were tyrannies then, but very feeble and ineffective beside the tyrannies of today; and even before the fission or fusion bombs were invented, the free world had condoned methods of war-making which until August 1914 had seemed forever abandoned as unworthy of civilized man. But the code then existing was shattered by the Germans—not the nihilistic Nazis, but the respectable Christian Germans of the Kaiserreich; and once they had done what they thought might help them win, their opponents imitated them—as they always will.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We entered this “world of barbarism” in 1914. That year indeed marked a turning point in the affairs of men. The outbreak of World War I that year was itself significant, for Christ Jesus, the great Prophet, foretold world war to mark the beginning of the “last days.” “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,” he said in his long-range prophecy, “and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957760/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The “pangs of distress” that have convulsed this world since 1914 mean good news to those who know their significance. They mean that God’s heavenly kingdom will soon destroy this wicked, warring world and bring permanent peace to the earth. True, the situation from a human standpoint appears hopeless. Jesus said it was certain to be that way, that there would be “on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation, while men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957760/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Even now that we have come into this time when war is so catastrophic a folly, men do not know the way out. They are far from certain that the incredible folly of atomic war will prevent another world war. How vital, then, for true Christians to put their trust, not in men, but in God! He is the One who has promised that during this unique period in history he will ruin those ruining the earth: “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time . . . to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957760/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 11:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">War is folly. It is folly also to trust in man to bring in permanent peace. God himself will do it. There will be no wars after Jehovah’s righteous war of Armageddon—no wars, not even wars with stone clubs. Jehovah’s promise is: “Come, behold the works of Jehovah, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957760/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

<strong>What Hope for Permanent World Peace?</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Armageddon’s war will sweep the earth clean of all wickedness, all unrighteousness, all corruption. Never again will nationalistic barriers divide earth’s inhabitants. Never again will there be different governments on earth at the same time, each claiming to be the right kind for the people. Never again will there be armies, navies, war planes, cannons, tanks, machine <span id="page488" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="488" data-before-text="488"></span>guns and atom bombs. And never again will there be bomb shelters, bomb craters, radio-active “death dust,” no man’s lands, fox holes, monuments to known and unknown soldiers, statues of bayonet-wielding soldiers or even military academies. For nothing, absolutely nothing, will spoil the peace or mar the beauty of God’s new world. This Jehovah guarantees: “Come near, and see God’s acts, his marvellous acts done on earth; how he puts an end to wars all over the world, the bow shivered, the weapons shattered, the shields burnt to ashes!” “I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954601/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 45:9, 10</a>, <em>Knox;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954601/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 65:17</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Clearly, then, Jehovah’s new world is man’s only hope for permanent world peace. Indeed it is a hope for much more! Because even if man could bring in a measure of peace, he would still need doctors, undertakers, grave diggers and tombstone makers. Yes, man would still have his life filled with tears, deep mourning, pain and outcries over keen suffering and heartaches. So man needs more than peace. He needs life. He needs health. But no kingdom of this evil world can put an end to the medicinal needs and the graveyards. Jehovah’s new world will! “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, . . . And he [God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954601/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954601/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 4</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>WHAT TO DO</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">To enjoy the blessings of permanent world peace, perfect health and everlasting life on a paradise earth after Armageddon, what must you do? The Bible answers: “Put on the complete suit of armor from God.” Why? “That you may be able to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil.” To fight such a spiritual warfare you also need the “sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word.” All this means that you must obtain a knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s written Word. Really, this in itself is a fight because people tend to think themselves too busy for Bible study. This too-busy outlook was foretold for our day by Jesus: “Just as it occurred in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of man: they were eating, they were drinking, men were marrying.” Nothing wrong with eating, drinking and marrying. Then what was wrong? This: the people engrossed themselves so deeply in the pursuits of life, all the while thinking that everything was going to continue as it always had, that they were unwilling to listen to and heed Noah’s warning of that world’s end. The result: “The flood arrived and destroyed them all.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954601/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Eph. 6:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954601/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954601/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Luke 17:26, 27</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">So take time to investigate the message of the peaceful new world that Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing you. Already a New World society of Christian men and women, who are living for the new world, is formed. Ally yourself with them. They are the sure victors, the survivors of Armageddon’s war. Forsake the man-made, doomed-to-failure peace plans of this Devil-controlled world. Take a positive stand for the new world, its government and King. Remember, there will be no neutrality at Armageddon. All who fail to decide for God’s kingdom are passive resisters of it. The King of the new world, Christ himself, laid down this strict, unbending rule: “He that is not on my side is against me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954601/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 12:30</a>, <em>NW</em>) So the time for indecision is past. Decide now. Act now. For soon, at Armageddon, a too-busy world, too busy to heed the warning of its own end, will be crushed out of existence. But there is no need for you to die.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>

We may be sure that he loves his spiritual Israel today, those who are Israelites inwardly by faith in Jehovah and in his promised Seed Jesus Christ. And now their good-will companions are beloved with them. Having the God of Jacob as our lofty retreat, there is no need for us to organize refuge farms in isolated places, retire to ourselves there and quit the field of activity as Kingdom publishers. Trust in the great God of Jacob is not demonstrated by hiding in seclusion but is demonstrated by courageously going forth onto the field of action and spreading his message of life. “Jehovah preserveth the faithful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 31:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) Retreating into him as our high tower means to keep in unity with him wherever we may be in the line of duty. That way we stay inside the organization of his theocratic people who are scattered all over the earth. By carrying out organization instructions as contained in God’s Word, we work like our fellow witnesses everywhere else.

Pss</em>.) This invitation, uttered by those within the visible organization of Jehovah God, positively assures us there will be survivors on earth after Armageddon will have swept away this old world with the broom of destruction and cleansed the earth for the righteous new world. The survivors will be informed and will know it is Jehovah by his mighty Warrior Jesus Christ who has set the then visible desolations in the earth. Such desolations will not have destroyed the earth or ruined it beyond restoration to a paradise state like the garden of Eden. They will only have ‘brought to ruin those ruining the earth’. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) God will not destroy his footstool, the earth, but will glorify it under the kingdom of his Christ.

But we may look for individuals of all nations to desist from all acts against Jehovah and his theocratic organization and to give in, be still and learn to know him and do good to Christ’s brothers. This means everlasting life.</p>

His power and authority are undeniable, a fact that everyone who wants to live forever will have to acknowledge.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“Give in and know that I am God.”</strong> Some Bible translations render the first part of this statement as “be still.” This has led to the misunderstanding that it is a command to be reverent or silent in church. However, the Hebrew phrase translated “give in and know that I am God” is an exhortation from Jehovah<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/502300128/0">a</a> God himself to people of all nations, urging them to stop opposing him and to recognize that only he is worthy of worship.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>A similar exhortation is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 2</a>. There, God promises to take action against those who oppose him. On the other hand, those who recognize God’s authority rely on him for guidance, strength, and wisdom. “Taking refuge in Him,” they feel happy and secure, especially during difficult times.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 2:9-12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>“I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted in the earth.”</strong> In the past, Jehovah God was exalted when he used his great strength to protect his people.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1, 2</a>) The words reminded them that Jehovah was always with them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 46:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>To strengthen their trust in Jehovah God’s protective power, the psalm invited them to reflect on his powerful works. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 46:8</a>) In particular, it directed attention to his ability to put an end to war. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 46:9</a>) In a sense, Jehovah brought an end to war in Bible times by protecting his people from enemy nations. However, the Bible promises that God will soon do so on an even greater scale when he brings an earth-wide end to war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502300128/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Does Jehovah still help his worshippers today?

<strong>Early Help for Surviving the World’s End</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> He now has at his disposal those twelve legions of angels, for the aid of which he refused to call on the night of his betrayal in Gethsemane. Like Jesus then, we do not now ask for these legions <span id="page188" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="188" data-before-text="188"></span>of angels to intervene in a violent way for us before the divine time. Yet we know they surround us with their protection. “The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 34:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) We know that at present they are “spirits for public service” whom God sends forth to minister to his Kingdom heirs and their companions of good will. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 1:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) Take courage, then, even though you seem standing alone. Jehovah of hosts is with each one of his people upon whom his name is called, because they stick on his side and proclaim his name.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>OUR REFUGE AND LOFTY RETREAT</strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21. How do we show the God of Jacob is a lofty retreat for us?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Jehovah loved Jacob rather than his older twin-brother Esau. He bestowed the birthright to the great Abrahamic promise upon Jacob and changed his name to Israel. We may be sure that he loves his spiritual Israel today, those who are Israelites inwardly by faith in Jehovah and in his promised Seed Jesus Christ. And now their good-will companions are beloved with them. Having the God of Jacob as our lofty retreat, there is no need for us to organize refuge farms in isolated places, retire to ourselves there and quit the field of activity as Kingdom publishers. Trust in the great God of Jacob is not demonstrated by hiding in seclusion but is demonstrated by courageously going forth onto the field of action and spreading his message of life. “Jehovah preserveth the faithful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 31:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) Retreating into him as our high tower means to keep in unity with him wherever we may be in the line of duty. That way we stay inside the organization of his theocratic people who are scattered all over the earth. By carrying out organization instructions as contained in God’s Word, we work like our fellow witnesses everywhere else. Unitedly we publish the name and government of Jehovah, bidding all life-seekers to take refuge under Him.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">22. What assurance does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 46:8, 9</a> give of survival? And who will make lasting peace, and how?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Wonderful it will be to realize the third and last stanza of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 46</a>. It takes the viewpoint of a survivor after the world calamity of Armageddon: “Come view the doings of Jehovah, who hath set desolations in the earth: causing wars to cease unto the end of the earth, the bow he breaketh and cutteth asunder the spear, waggons he burneth with fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9</a>, <em>Ro. Pss</em>.) This invitation, uttered by those within the visible organization of Jehovah God, positively assures us there will be survivors on earth after Armageddon will have swept away this old world with the broom of destruction and cleansed the earth for the righteous new world. The survivors will be informed and will know it is Jehovah by his mighty Warrior Jesus Christ who has set the then visible desolations in the earth. Such desolations will not have destroyed the earth or ruined it beyond restoration to a paradise state like the garden of Eden. They will only have ‘brought to ruin those ruining the earth’. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) God will not destroy his footstool, the earth, but will glorify it under the kingdom of his Christ. Thus it is Jehovah by Christ who ends all forms of war on the earth by destroying all the warmongers, ‘scattering the peoples that delight in war’ and demolishing their terrible weapons of war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 68:30</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">23.

It will be those who heed the command of the Most High God at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 46:10</a> (<em>AS</em>): “Be still [Give in, <em>Mo;</em> Desist, Ro.

Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.” After decades of testimony we may not now expect political and religious rulers to appreciate and follow this advice and learn to know that Jehovah is God in a way that means salvation to them. But we may look for individuals of all nations to desist from all acts against Jehovah and his theocratic organization and to give in, be still and learn to know him and do good to Christ’s brothers. This means everlasting life.</p>

<strong>Shepherd of Israel</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The Great Shepherd, Jehovah, and the Right Shepherd, Christ Jesus, have led the flock into the blessed condition they enjoy today. They, as Jehovah’s witnesses, have been led, fed and protected through many trials and temptations from within and without, from false teachings, from false brothers, from terrors through those who would devour them. Through these past forty years Jehovah’s witnesses have lacked no good thing. Regardless of the most terrible and fear-inspiring world conditions, Jehovah and Christ have protected their flock. Through world wars, prisons, <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>concentration camps, revolutions, disease, epidemics, famines, strikes and race hatreds, as a flock they have been led, continually conscious of the antitypical cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. The presence of Jehovah and his Shepherd-King has been with them. They have feared nothing bad. How favored our lot to have them as our shepherds! “The God of Jacob is a secure height for us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 46:11</a>) Those witnesses of Jehovah who have gone through these forty years have never missed a spiritual meal, nor thirsted for the water of life. In fact, they have had such plenty that they could well afford to proclaim for the benefit of others: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 55:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) Today, after all these years, are not Jehovah’s witnesses out day by day, yes, even hour by hour, still extending to people of good will the gracious invitation: ‘Come, receive food, come to the pools of water. Here are green pastures. The Shepherd of Israel, he is our shepherd. We shall lack nothing. He arranges a table before us in front of those showing hostility to us. We eat and drink, while the Shepherd protects us’? How like sheep His people are! Are you in this blessed and happy fold? Can you say with certainty, “Jehovah is my Shepherd”? If not, then do not delay, but come into the fold, out of the isolation and cold, and meet with Jehovah’s sheep and be at peace.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>THE RIGHT SHEPHERD</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 8.

Yes, he is a faithful Shepherd. This Shepherd is the beauty of Israel, the most glorious one in all Jehovah’s organization. He is the delightful one, “altogether desirable,” “the most conspicuous of ten thousand.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Cant. 5:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Who cannot but love and adore him? “And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mic. 4:8</a>, <em>AS</em>) Truly the dominion has come to him. He is the “bright morning star,” the joy of all peoples. Not only has he been given dominion, but he is now in the throne. Hence his sheep “will hunger no more nor thirst any more, neither will the sun beat down upon them nor any scorching heat, because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them, and will guide them to fountains of waters of life. And God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 7:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 9.

The Scriptures say: “This one was originally with God. All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence. What has come into existence by means of him was life, and the life was the light of men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 1:2-4</a>) The proverbial word says: “When [God] prepared the heavens I was there; when he decreed a horizon upon the face of the surging waters, when he made firm the cloud masses above, . . . when he decreed the foundations of the earth, then I came to be beside him as a master worker and I came to be what he was specially fond of day by day, I being glad before him all the time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 8:27-30</a>) In due time <span id="page179" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="179" data-before-text="179"></span>this wise Son came to this earth as a man to provide the price for purchasing the flock of God. He himself said: “I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance. . . . I surrender my soul in behalf of the sheep. And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd. This is why the Father loves me, because I surrender my soul” in behalf of the sheep. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 10:10-17</a>) The apostle Paul writes: “For you know the undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich he became poor for your sakes, that you might become rich through his poverty.” “He emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men. More than that, when he found himself in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake. For this very reason also God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958207/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:7-9</a>) What a shepherd! He is the one whom we all look up to and joyfully follow. The Shepherd, who is also the Lamb, is adored by all who are God’s sheep. How blessed we are to know these marvelous things!</p>

What do those now exalting Jehovah shout out, and how do they prove it?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> It is here at the earth, now a hotbed of rebellion and devil worship, that Jehovah must be exalted forever. Those who in this time of world crisis exalt Jehovah can shout out with assurance the closing words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 46</a>: “Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 46:11</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> This is our confession publicly when war scares and alarms and national fears drive people into non-theocratic man-made organizations for cover and defense. They lack faith and disregard the divine promises and follow instead worldly wisdom, ideologies and religions. We dare not fear their fear. We may not now resort to human refuges and become like the faithless people of this world. We must make known that Jehovah of hosts is the God of victory and is with us and is our secure retreat. This we will do, not by bragging about our organization, but by taking him at his Word and displaying our confidence in him. He is with us if we are with him, not becoming part of this doomed world or indulging in friendship with it, but adhering unwaveringly to his organization and expanding his pure worship. By our course of action as well as by our words we must demonstrate that our trust is not in weapons of carnal warfare but that we are fighting on Jehovah’s side with the spiritual armor from him. It helps to build up the confidence of all the scattered sheep in Jehovah the Great Shepherd when we ourselves show no worldly fear but manifest unshakable reliance upon him. We must vigorously help those other sheep now to find the one safe refuge and enter into it.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">26. What now is it our Christian obligation to be and do?</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> Our Christian obligation now is to be fearless in Jehovah God’s service, under the shadow of his mighty hand. He encourages us not to droop our hands out of fear, but to keep them busy in the constructive work of Bible education among people of good will. So keep calm and go on peacefully about your work as his ministers of good news. As never before, make the time count now, for the time in which he is showing patience and may yet be found is short. He will never forsake his faithful ones, but will help us, “and that right early.”</p>

<strong>Making Melody to Jehovah with Instrumental Music</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">With music, as with everything else that we do to God’s glory, balance is desirable. Instrumental music, aside from accompanying the singing, is really incidental, although it does add to the festiveness of the assembly, even as does a beautifully arranged platform. But often the tendency of those in charge of music is to go to extremes, to go “overboard,” as it were.

It would seem that there is ample opportunity for originality and inventiveness and musical inspiration within the limits of the sentiments of the words that are inseparably wedded to the musical themes. Talented arrangers can tend to overarrange, bringing in subtle effects in modulations and dynamics that most likely are lost on all save a few musically knowledgeable listeners who take the time and pains to listen attentively.

<strong>Now Is the Due Time to Welcome the Universal Sovereign</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Today in this year of 1978 C.E. the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” at Har–Magedon approaches. Now, long since the Gentile Times ended in 1914, “Jehovah of armies” is especially “the glorious King.” Why so? Because, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978167/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 47:8</a> foretold, “God has become king over the nations,” he again acting as the Universal Sovereign toward our earth. He will display his mightiness in further maintaining at Har–Magedon “the kingdom of the world . . . the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978167/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>) Jehovah’s Christ, the Son greater than King David, is the one whom he has enthroned to represent Him in the world government. First, Jehovah of armies, attended by his Son Jesus Christ and armies of heavenly angels, will rid the universe of today’s wicked system of things. Then he will bless mankind with righteous world rulership through his Son, Jesus Christ. This grand prospect gets nearer to its realization!</p>
