<strong>“Praise the Name of Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[47]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Love for God moves faithful people to praise his name wholeheartedly. King David wrote: “Let me praise Jehovah; let everything within me praise his holy name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024281/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 103:1</a>) David understood that to praise Jehovah’s name is to praise Jehovah himself. Jehovah’s name involves his reputation, so it brings to mind all his beautiful qualities and his marvelous deeds. David wanted to treat his Father’s name as holy and to praise it. <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>He wanted to do so with “everything within” him​—that is, wholeheartedly. Similarly, the Levites took the lead in praising Jehovah. They humbly admitted that their words could never fully express the praise that Jehovah’s sacred name deserves. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024281/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Nehemiah 9:5</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Without a doubt, such humble, heartfelt praise brought joy to Jehovah’s heart.</p>

<strong>“Bless Jehovah, O My Soul”</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">King David of ancient Israel composed the 103rd <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a>. He opens with the words: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul, even everything within me, his holy name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 103:1</a>) “The word <em>bless,</em> as applied to God,” says one reference work, “means to praise, implying always a strong affection for him as well as a sense of gratitude.” Desiring to praise Jehovah with a heart full of love and appreciation, David exhorts his own soul​—himself—​to “bless Jehovah.” But what generates this warm feeling in David’s heart toward the God he worships?</p>

<strong>They Shall Talk of the Glory of Jehovah’s Kingdom</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 145</a>, David, a man after God’s own heart, was talking about the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom. There is no glory in the kingdoms of this old world. Now we know of Jehovah’s kingdom as revealed through his Word, and it is a government based on love, righteousness, peace and justice. Which do you want? Which will you serve? We have just looked at the old world. How do we see the new world? We see it represented in the people whom Jehovah God has gathered together today and built into an organization, a New World society. Yes, they are still living on this globe that they know is, since 1914, his eminent domain, but they have come out of that old world. They have all the infirmities and sicknesses of the common man, but not the unhappiness and selfishness of this old world. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, he has, in these “last days,” gathered together those who are seeking him, seeking righteousness, meekness, happiness, contentment, and he has brought them into the New World society. The 145th Psalm shows how Jehovah God will reach out to help those who have fallen and who want to get up, and to help those who have been forced to bow down. <span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>He offers them his hand; he says he will feed them. There is a great contrast in principle governing these two organizations, Jehovah’s and the Devil’s. The Devil’s is a wicked, selfish world, oppressing people. Jehovah’s is the glorious kingdom based on love and sinlessness, for he arranged to take away the sin of the world by the blood of his Lamb, Christ Jesus.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">17.

But let us go beyond just his people and look into the earth itself, even to the animal kingdom. He satisfies even all their desires. The birds that fly above the earth fully enjoy their life span though it is short. He satisfies their needs by the food, by the nests, by the trees and by the open sky in which to fly. Look in any department of creation—the animal life that crawls upon the earth or the fish that are in the sea—he satisfies all their needs. Well, if he looks after them so thoroughly, certainly he will look after you, if you come within his organization. What a marvelous provision he has made for everything that he has created in the heavens and on earth! “Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:26</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">18.

How can we be when it is a natural thing for us to talk about someone who loves us and whom we love, and whom we want to bless? “To bless” means to bestow favor or honor upon, or to speak well of a person. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a> (<em>AS</em>) shows how those who have come to know Jehovah God want to do this.

He has provided the truth for all to follow and to benefit by it. He will show all the way to gain eternal life if they want to know. He has redeemed you from destruction in this old world because you have come into his New World society. If you have not come you can do so, or at least can investigate. He has crowned you with loving-kindness <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>and he has shown you his tender mercies by making his Word accessible. If you study the Bible, he will satisfy every desire. Then you can say: ‘I have the truth. I know Jehovah. I appreciate that I can work for him and that I can gain life by continually taking in knowledge of him.’ And what does that do to us? It keeps us young; it keeps us alive; it keeps us active in his New World society, as representatives of him. “We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us.

<strong>“Bless Jehovah, O My Soul”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">David continues: “Do not forget all his [Jehovah’s] doings.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 103:2</a>) Feeling grateful to Jehovah is evidently connected with meditating appreciatively on “his doings.” Exactly what doings of Jehovah does David have in mind? Looking at Jehovah God’s creation, such as a star-studded sky on a clear night, can indeed fill the heart with gratitude for the Creator. The starry heavens touched David deeply.

<strong>Diseases and Treatment</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Jehovah can remove sicknesses.

Christians thus have a basis for hope and abundant proof that through the resurrected Jesus Christ and by means of God’s Kingdom, obedient mankind will receive, not merely temporary treatment of disease, but permanent release from sin, disease, and death traceable to Adam. For this all praise is due Jehovah, identified by David as the one “who is healing all your maladies.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001191/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Ps 103:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001191/71/1" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> Re 21:1-5</a>.</p>

<strong>Healing</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the blessings Jehovah bestowed on all mankind is the regenerative power of their physical organisms, the ability of the body to heal itself when wounded or diseased. A physician may recommend certain measures to speed recovery, but in reality it is the God-given recuperative powers within the body that accomplish the healing. Hence, the psalmist David acknowledged that though he was born imperfect, his Creator was able to sustain him during illness and heal all his maladies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 41:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 103:2-4</a>) Jehovah restored the bodily health of afflicted Job (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:10</a>) and God also provided physical healing for his people Israel.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 15:26</a>.</p>

<strong>“Bless Jehovah, O My Soul”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>Jehovah “Is Forgiving All Your Error”</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In this psalm, David recounts God’s acts of loving-kindness. Referring to the first and foremost among these, he sings: ‘Jehovah is forgiving all your error.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 103:3</a>) David was certainly aware of his own sinful state. After Nathan the prophet confronted him about his adulterous relationship with Bath-sheba, David admitted: “Against you [Jehovah], you alone, I have sinned, and what is bad in your eyes I have done.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 51:4</a>) With a broken heart, he made the entreaty: “Show me favor, O God, according to your loving-kindness. According to the abundance of your mercies wipe out my transgressions. Thoroughly wash me from my error, and cleanse me even from my sin.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 51:1, 2</a>) How grateful David must have felt to be forgiven! Being an imperfect human, he committed other sins in his life, but he never failed to repent, <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>accept reproof, and correct his ways. Reflection on God’s marvelous acts of kindness toward him moved David to bless Jehovah.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Are we not also sinful? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Even the apostle Paul lamented: “I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members. Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Romans 7:22-24</a>) How grateful we can be that Jehovah does not keep account of our transgressions! He gladly erases them when we repent and seek forgiveness.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">David reminds himself: “[Jehovah] is healing all your maladies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 103:3</a>) Since healing is an act of restoration, it entails more than forgiveness of wrongdoing. It involves the removal of “maladies”​—the bad consequences of the error of our ways. In the new world of his making, Jehovah will indeed eradicate the physical consequences of sin, such as sickness and death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:1-4</a>) Even today, however, God is healing us of spiritual maladies. For some, these include a bad conscience and a severed relationship with him. “Do not forget” what Jehovah has already done for each of us personally in this regard.</p>

<strong>“You Must Not Forget”</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Religion, some form of worship, is something that everyone in the world is involved in in one way or another. The natural tendency of man is to worship something. People whom we call “heathen” <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>or “pagan” have gods that they worship. Some people worship money, movie stars, politicians, rulers, even themselves. It may be an image or something illusive, nirvana, for instance. But let us take a second look at Christendom, while we are on the subject, and seriously ask: What has Christendom’s religion done for mankind? Has it made the nations and its people better morally, spiritually? Has it made them peaceful? Do they love one another more now than fifty years ago or five hundred years ago? Has Christendom brought “glory . . . to God, and upon earth peace among men of good will”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969001/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 2:14</a>) Why not? Because mankind and its religious priests and clergy have forgotten God, discarded his Word and rejected Jehovah’s kingdom by his Son Christ Jesus. Jesus said it plainly: “This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969001/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 15:8, 9</a>) The false religions are not teaching you God’s Word but they are teaching you their own doctrine.

<strong>‘Neither Will Pain Be Any More’</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the first place, let us note that pain is not an unmixed evil. Far from it! Pain is a wise provision of the Creator to alert us to danger. Persons whose bodies are wholly insensitive to pain—and there are such—are very unfortunate. Some of these have walked about for days with a fractured bone, wholly unaware of their condition. Others have severely burned themselves on stoves and radiators or otherwise injured themselves unknowingly because of being unable to feel any pain. However, while God wisely created us with the capacity for sensation, including pain, he did <span id="page36" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="36" data-before-text="36"></span>not purpose us to be in bondage to pain.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">That bondage cannot be blamed upon God but upon our first parents. When, due to their selfish disobedience, they were sentenced to return to the ground out of which they were taken, God said to Eve: “I shall greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in birth pangs you will bring forth children.” And to Adam: “Cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life.” Not that God arbitrarily decreed that man and woman must suffer, but rather that pain is the concomitant of imperfection, sin and death; it is part of the dying process.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 3:16-19</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What about the many who are in bondage to pain because of their own follies? They may have overindulged in food or liquor over the years, or gone to other extremes as regards pleasure or work. How much suffering has been caused by carelessness at home, in factories and on the highway! Surely, many who blame God, if honest, would have to admit that they could with better reason blame themselves.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">We should not overlook the fact that our mental attitude toward pain can either increase or diminish its severity. Reasoning upon it may help us to bear it, or even rejoice over it, as did the apostles because they had been accounted worthy to suffer for Christ. Then again, by occupying our minds with something else or keeping busy we may be able to forget our pain, at least temporarily.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 5:40, 41</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Thus God’s Word helps us to bear pain, for it not only tells us why He has permitted it but assures us that it will soon end. Foremost among God’s reasons for permitting pain is to prove Satan a liar when he boasted that he could turn all men away from God. Thus, as we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:1-11</a>, God permitted Satan to afflict Job to test his integrity. Was it worth while? It most certainly was. It vindicated Jehovah God by proving Satan the Devil a liar and brought rich rewards to Job. When God’s purpose in this regard has been fully served, man’s bondage to pain will end.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 42:12-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jas. 5:11</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Further, as we have noted, bondage to pain is a concomitant of imperfection, sin and death. Since it is God’s purpose to end these evils on the basis of his Son’s sacrifice and by means of his kingdom, bondage to pain will also end. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 1:29</a>) In God’s due time obedient ones will receive the benefits of Christ’s sacrifice under the Kingdom for which we have been praying. In it Christ will reign until he has put all enemies under his feet, including bondage to pain and the last enemy, death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:25, 26</a>) Yes, then God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.” Then the prophetic words that now have a spiritual application will also have a literal fulfillment: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul, . . . who is healing all your diseases.” “And no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ps. 103:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Isa. 33:24</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When will all this begin to take place? In our day. Fulfillment of Bible prophecy shows we are living at the end of this old system of things and at the threshold of a new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness is to dwell; a world without sin, without death and without pain.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960040/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">So let all take comfort and hope. Instead of rebelling at your lot, pray to God for strength to endure patiently and cheerfully while you look forward to the blessed day when there will be no more pain.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

<strong>They Shall Talk of the Glory of Jehovah’s Kingdom</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 145</a>, David, a man after God’s own heart, was talking about the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom. There is no glory in the kingdoms of this old world. Now we know of Jehovah’s kingdom as revealed through his Word, and it is a government based on love, righteousness, peace and justice. Which do you want? Which will you serve? We have just looked at the old world. How do we see the new world? We see it represented in the people whom Jehovah God has gathered together today and built into an organization, a New World society. Yes, they are still living on this globe that they know is, since 1914, his eminent domain, but they have come out of that old world. They have all the infirmities and sicknesses of the common man, but not the unhappiness and selfishness of this old world. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, he has, in these “last days,” gathered together those who are seeking him, seeking righteousness, meekness, happiness, contentment, and he has brought them into the New World society. The 145th Psalm shows how Jehovah God will reach out to help those who have fallen and who want to get up, and to help those who have been forced to bow down. <span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>He offers them his hand; he says he will feed them. There is a great contrast in principle governing these two organizations, Jehovah’s and the Devil’s. The Devil’s is a wicked, selfish world, oppressing people. Jehovah’s is the glorious kingdom based on love and sinlessness, for he arranged to take away the sin of the world by the blood of his Lamb, Christ Jesus.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">17. Whose need and desire does Jehovah satisfy?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 145:14-16</a> shows how Jehovah helps the poor and lowly of heart, for he ‘satisfies the desire of every living thing.’ Well, certainly those who have come to know Jehovah and have studied his Word have been satisfied with truth and their present happiness in life. But let us go beyond just his people and look into the earth itself, even to the animal kingdom. He satisfies even all their desires. The birds that fly above the earth fully enjoy their life span though it is short. He satisfies their needs by the food, by the nests, by the trees and by the open sky in which to fly. Look in any department of creation—the animal life that crawls upon the earth or the fish that are in the sea—he satisfies all their needs. Well, if he looks after them so thoroughly, certainly he will look after you, if you come within his organization. What a marvelous provision he has made for everything that he has created in the heavens and on earth! “Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:26</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">18.

He has provided the truth for all to follow and to benefit by it. He will show all the way to gain eternal life if they want to know. He has redeemed you from destruction in this old world because you have come into his New World society. If you have not come you can do so, or at least can investigate. He has crowned you with loving-kindness <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>and he has shown you his tender mercies by making his Word accessible. If you study the Bible, he will satisfy every desire. Then you can say: ‘I have the truth. I know Jehovah.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 103:4</a>) “The very pit” is the common grave of mankind​—Sheol, or Hades. Even before becoming a king over Israel, David found himself in the jaws of death. For example, Israel’s King Saul nurtured a murderous hatred toward David and attempted to kill him on various occasions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Samuel 18:9-29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 23:6-29</a>) The Philistines also wanted David dead.

Has Jehovah sustained you through periods of depression or times of loss? Or have you come to know of instances when he has reclaimed the lives of his faithful Witnesses from the pit of Sheol in our times? Perhaps you have been touched by reading accounts of his acts of deliverance in the pages of this magazine. Why not take time to reflect appreciatively on these doings of the true God? And, of course, all of us have reason to be grateful to Jehovah for the resurrection hope.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah gives us both life and that which makes it enjoyable and worth living. The psalmist declares that God “is crowning you with loving-kindness and mercies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 103:4</a>) In our hour of need, Jehovah does not abandon us but comes to our aid through his visible organization and the appointed elders, or shepherds, in the congregation. Such help enables us to deal with a trying situation without losing our self-respect and dignity. Christian shepherds care very much for the sheep. They encourage the sick and depressed and do all they can to restore those who have fallen. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Jude 22, 23</a>) Jehovah’s spirit motivates these shepherds to be compassionate and loving toward the flock. His “loving-kindness and mercies” are indeed like a crown that adorns us and gives us dignity! Never forgetting his doings, let us bless Jehovah and his holy name.</p>

<strong>“You Must Not Forget”</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Religion, some form of worship, is something that everyone in the world is involved in in one way or another. The natural tendency of man is to worship something. People whom we call “heathen” <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>or “pagan” have gods that they worship. Some people worship money, movie stars, politicians, rulers, even themselves. It may be an image or something illusive, nirvana, for instance. But let us take a second look at Christendom, while we are on the subject, and seriously ask: What has Christendom’s religion done for mankind? Has it made the nations and its people better morally, spiritually? Has it made them peaceful? Do they love one another more now than fifty years ago or five hundred years ago? Has Christendom brought “glory . . . to God, and upon earth peace among men of good will”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969001/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 2:14</a>) Why not? Because mankind and its religious priests and clergy have forgotten God, discarded his Word and rejected Jehovah’s kingdom by his Son Christ Jesus. Jesus said it plainly: “This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969001/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 15:8, 9</a>) The false religions are not teaching you God’s Word but they are teaching you their own doctrine. Listen to God, for he is saying to you now: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969001/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4</a>) Christendom and the whole world empire of false religion are doomed!</p>

<strong>They Shall Talk of the Glory of Jehovah’s Kingdom</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 145</a>, David, a man after God’s own heart, was talking about the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom. There is no glory in the kingdoms of this old world. Now we know of Jehovah’s kingdom as revealed through his Word, and it is a government based on love, righteousness, peace and justice. Which do you want? Which will you serve? We have just looked at the old world. How do we see the new world? We see it represented in the people whom Jehovah God has gathered together today and built into an organization, a New World society. Yes, they are still living on this globe that they know is, since 1914, his eminent domain, but they have come out of that old world. They have all the infirmities and sicknesses of the common man, but not the unhappiness and selfishness of this old world. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, he has, in these “last days,” gathered together those who are seeking him, seeking righteousness, meekness, happiness, contentment, and he has brought them into the New World society. The 145th Psalm shows how Jehovah God will reach out to help those who have fallen and who want to get up, and to help those who have been forced to bow down. <span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>He offers them his hand; he says he will feed them. There is a great contrast in principle governing these two organizations, Jehovah’s and the Devil’s. The Devil’s is a wicked, selfish world, oppressing people. Jehovah’s is the glorious kingdom based on love and sinlessness, for he arranged to take away the sin of the world by the blood of his Lamb, Christ Jesus.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">17. Whose need and desire does Jehovah satisfy?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 145:14-16</a> shows how Jehovah helps the poor and lowly of heart, for he ‘satisfies the desire of every living thing.’ Well, certainly those who have come to know Jehovah and have studied his Word have been satisfied with truth and their present happiness in life. But let us go beyond just his people and look into the earth itself, even to the animal kingdom. He satisfies even all their desires. The birds that fly above the earth fully enjoy their life span though it is short. He satisfies their needs by the food, by the nests, by the trees and by the open sky in which to fly. Look in any department of creation—the animal life that crawls upon the earth or the fish that are in the sea—he satisfies all their needs. Well, if he looks after them so thoroughly, certainly he will look after you, if you come within his organization. What a marvelous provision he has made for everything that he has created in the heavens and on earth! “Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:26</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">18.

How can we be when it is a natural thing for us to talk about someone who loves us and whom we love, and whom we want to bless? “To bless” means to bestow favor or honor upon, or to speak well of a person. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a> (<em>AS</em>) shows how those who have come to know Jehovah God want to do this.

Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; who satisfieth thy desire with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.”</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">19. Why, then, ought we also to bless Jehovah and his holy name? And what keeps us active as His representatives?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Do you bless Jehovah and his holy name?

He has provided the truth for all to follow and to benefit by it. He will show all the way to gain eternal life if they want to know. He has redeemed you from destruction in this old world because you have come into his New World society. If you have not come you can do so, or at least can investigate.

<strong>Eagle</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Another text that many scholars view as applying to the vulture rather than to the eagle is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001235/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Micah 1:16</a>, which speaks of Israel’s figuratively ‘broadening out its baldness like that of the eagle.’ The eagle’s head is well feathered; even the North American bald eagle is referred to as “bald” only because its white head feathers give it the appearance of baldness from a distance. The griffon vulture (<em>Gyps fulvus</em>), still to be seen in Israel, has only some soft white down on its head, and the neck is sparsely feathered. If the text applies to it, this would indicate that the Hebrew <em>neʹsher</em> has broader application than to the eagle only. It may be noted that the griffon vulture, while not classed by ornithologists as of the same “species” or “genus” as the eagle, is counted as of the same “family” (Accipitridae). Some, however, believe <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001235/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Micah 1:16</a> has reference to the molting that the eagle undergoes, although this is said to be a gradual and rather inconspicuous process. This molting process, bringing some reduction of activity and strength and followed by a renewal of normal life, may be what the psalmist meant by one’s youth “renewing itself just like that of an eagle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001235/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 103:5</a>) Others see in this a reference to the relatively long life of the eagle, some having been known to reach an age of 80 years.</p>

<strong>“Bless Jehovah, O My Soul”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Continuing on with his self-admonition, the psalmist David sings: “[Jehovah] is satisfying your lifetime with what is good; your youth keeps renewing itself just like that of an eagle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 103:5</a>) The life Jehovah gives is one of satisfaction and joy. Why, the very knowledge of the truth itself <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>is a treasure beyond compare and a source of tremendous joy! And consider how deeply satisfying is the work Jehovah has given us, that of preaching and making disciples. What a delight it is to find someone interested in learning about the true God and to help that one come to know Jehovah and bless him! Yet, whether anyone in our locality listens or not, it is a grand privilege to have a share in a work connected with the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the vindication of his sovereignty.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">While persisting in the work of proclaiming God’s Kingdom, who does not become tired or grow weary? But Jehovah keeps renewing the strength of his servants, making them ‘like eagles’ that have powerful wings and soar to great heights in the sky. How grateful we can be that our loving heavenly Father provides such “dynamic energy” so that we can faithfully carry out our ministry day after day!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">To illustrate: Clara holds a full-time secular job and also spends about 50 hours every month in the field ministry. She says: “Sometimes I am tired, and I force myself to go out in the field service only because I have made an arrangement to work with someone. But once I am out, I always feel invigorated.” You too may have experienced the vigor that results from divine support in the Christian ministry. May you be moved to say, as did David in the opening words of this psalm: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul, even everything within me, his holy name.”</p>

However, although the eagle is not primarily a carrion eater, as is the vulture, it does feed on such dead bodies at times. (<em>Palestine Exploration Quarterly,</em> April, 1955, p. 9) So, too, the eagle, though usually a solitary hunter, unlike the gregarious vulture, is known to hunt in pairs occasionally, and the book <em>The Animal Kingdom</em> (1954, Frederick Drimmer, M.A., editor in chief, Vol. II, p. 965) reports an instance in which “a number of them launched a mass attack upon a prong-horned antelope.” Jesus’ prophecy above-mentioned was given in connection with his promised second coming or “presence.” Hence, it would not apply merely to the desolation of the Jewish nation by the Roman armies with their standards emblazoned with the figures of eagles, an event taking place in the year 70 C.E. The later vision at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11-21</a> parallels Jesus’ prophecy in many respects and depicts a “carcass” formed of earth’s kings, their armies, and all having the mark of the beast. Eagles are elsewhere used in Revelation to represent creatures attending God’s throne and announcing the judgment messages of God for those on earth, doubtless to indicate swiftness and farsightedness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 4:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 8:13</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezekiel 1:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 10:14</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Another text that many scholars view as applying to the vulture rather than to the eagle is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Micah 1:16</a>, which speaks of Israel’s figuratively ‘broadening out its baldness like that of the eagle.’ The eagle’s head is well feathered, even the North American “bald eagle” being called thus only because its white head feathers give it the appearance of baldness from a distance. The Griffon vulture, common in Palestine, has only some soft white down on its head, and the neck is sparsely feathered. If the text applies to it, this would indicate that the Hebrew <em>ne·sherʹ</em> has broader application than to the eagle only. It may be noted that the Griffon vulture, while not classed by ornithologists as of the same “species” or “genus” as the eagle, is counted as of the same “family” (<em>Accipitridae</em>). Some, however, believe <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Micah 1:16</a> has reference to the moulting that the eagle undergoes, although this is said to be a quite gradual and rather inconspicuous process. This moulting process, bringing some reduction of activity and strength and followed by a renewal of normal life, may be what the psalmist meant by one’s youth “renewing itself just like that of an eagle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 103:5</a>) Others see in this a reference to the relatively long life of the eagle, some having been known to reach an age of eighty years.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The name “Aquila” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 18:2</a>) is Latin for eagle.</p>

<strong>They Shall Talk of the Glory of Jehovah’s Kingdom</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 145</a>, David, a man after God’s own heart, was talking about the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom. There is no glory in the kingdoms of this old world. Now we know of Jehovah’s kingdom as revealed through his Word, and it is a government based on love, righteousness, peace and justice. Which do you want? Which will you serve? We have just looked at the old world. How do we see the new world? We see it represented in the people whom Jehovah God has gathered together today and built into an organization, a New World society. Yes, they are still living on this globe that they know is, since 1914, his eminent domain, but they have come out of that old world. They have all the infirmities and sicknesses of the common man, but not the unhappiness and selfishness of this old world. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, he has, in these “last days,” gathered together those who are seeking him, seeking righteousness, meekness, happiness, contentment, and he has brought them into the New World society. The 145th Psalm shows how Jehovah God will reach out to help those who have fallen and who want to get up, and to help those who have been forced to bow down. <span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>He offers them his hand; he says he will feed them. There is a great contrast in principle governing these two organizations, Jehovah’s and the Devil’s. The Devil’s is a wicked, selfish world, oppressing people. Jehovah’s is the glorious kingdom based on love and sinlessness, for he arranged to take away the sin of the world by the blood of his Lamb, Christ Jesus.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">17. Whose need and desire does Jehovah satisfy?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 145:14-16</a> shows how Jehovah helps the poor and lowly of heart, for he ‘satisfies the desire of every living thing.’ Well, certainly those who have come to know Jehovah and have studied his Word have been satisfied with truth and their present happiness in life. But let us go beyond just his people and look into the earth itself, even to the animal kingdom. He satisfies even all their desires. The birds that fly above the earth fully enjoy their life span though it is short. He satisfies their needs by the food, by the nests, by the trees and by the open sky in which to fly. Look in any department of creation—the animal life that crawls upon the earth or the fish that are in the sea—he satisfies all their needs. Well, if he looks after them so thoroughly, certainly he will look after you, if you come within his organization. What a marvelous provision he has made for everything that he has created in the heavens and on earth! “Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:26</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">18.

How can we be when it is a natural thing for us to talk about someone who loves us and whom we love, and whom we want to bless? “To bless” means to bestow favor or honor upon, or to speak well of a person. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a> (<em>AS</em>) shows how those who have come to know Jehovah God want to do this. Its first five verses <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps 103:1-5</a> express their gratitude: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; who satisfieth thy desire with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.”</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">19. Why, then, ought we also to bless Jehovah and his holy name? And what keeps us active as His representatives?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Do you bless Jehovah and his holy name? You ought to, because you have seen all of his benefits, or can see them if you look. He has healed you and helped you into the path of the living, or will heal you if you seek him and the truth. He has provided the truth for all to follow and to benefit by it. He will show all the way to gain eternal life if they want to know. He has redeemed you from destruction in this old world because you have come into his New World society. If you have not come you can do so, or at least can investigate. He has crowned you with loving-kindness <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>and he has shown you his tender mercies by making his Word accessible. If you study the Bible, he will satisfy every desire. Then you can say: ‘I have the truth. I know Jehovah. I appreciate that I can work for him and that I can gain life by continually taking in knowledge of him.’ And what does that do to us? It keeps us young; it keeps us alive; it keeps us active in his New World society, as representatives of him. “We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us. As substitutes for Christ we beg: ‘Become reconciled to God.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:20</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

<strong>‘Jehovah Remembers that We Are Dust’</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Against the background of God’s dealings with ancient Israel, the psalmist David said: “Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness. He will not for all time keep finding fault, neither will he to time indefinite keep resentful. He has not done to us even according to our sins; nor according to our errors has he brought upon us what we deserve.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975641/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 103:8-10</a>) Neither the nature nor the extent of the sin, but primarily God’s mercy and his purpose determined how Jehovah treated the wayward Israelites.

In fact, he was the most mild and gentle man ever to walk this earth. When inviting others to take upon them his yoke and become his disciples, Jesus said: “I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29</a>) This one who was so peaceable that he proved fully worthy of the title “Prince of Peace” not only displayed mildness in his personal life and activity but also preached to others that they too should live a life of peace and mildness. Here is how Jesus stated this fundamental Christian principle on one occasion: “I say to you who are listening, Continue to love your enemies, to do good to those hating you, to bless those cursing you, to pray for those who do you injury. To him that strikes you on the one cheek offer the other also.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 6:27-29</a>) At times Jesus and his traveling companions were exhausted from their walking and talking and they sought a little seclusion and rest. However, the crowds rudely intruded upon their privacy. Instead of harshly rebuking them, Jesus suppressed his own personal feelings and tenderly and compassionately cared for their spiritual and physical needs.

<strong>‘Jehovah Remembers that We Are Dust’</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Against the background of God’s dealings with ancient Israel, the psalmist David said: “Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness. He will not for all time keep finding fault, neither will he to time indefinite keep resentful. He has not done to us even according to our sins; nor according to our errors has he brought upon us what we deserve.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975641/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 103:8-10</a>) Neither the nature nor the extent of the sin, but primarily God’s mercy and his purpose determined how Jehovah treated the wayward Israelites. His dominant spirit toward them was not one of continuing anger.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975641/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 30:5</a>.</p>

<strong>He Remembers That “We Are Dust”</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>“As the heavens are higher than the earth, his loving-kindness is superior toward those fearing him.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011566/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Verse 11</a>) When we look up at the night sky, we cannot fathom the great distance between the starry heavens and the earth. David thus impresses upon us the magnitude of Jehovah’s mercy, a facet of his loyal love. This mercy is for “those fearing” God​—those who have “a humble, hearty reverence of his authority,” says one scholar.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1438/0">7/1/2003, p. 17</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>“God Is Love”</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The psalmist David used a vivid expression to describe Jehovah’s forgiveness: “As far as <em>the east is from the west,</em> so far has He removed our transgressions from us.” (Italics ours; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003483/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 103:12</a>, <em>The Amplified Bible</em>) How far is east from west? In a sense, east is always at the utmost distance imaginable from west; the two points can never meet. One scholar notes that this expression means “as far as possible; as far as we can imagine.” David’s inspired words tell us that when Jehovah forgives, he puts our sins as far away from us as we can imagine.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1439/0">5/15/1999, p. 24</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>“Bless Jehovah, O My Soul”</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Consider also how tenderly Jehovah delivers us from the burden of sin. He has provided “the blood of the Christ” to “cleanse our consciences from dead works.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:14</a>) When we repent of our sins and seek forgiveness on the basis of Christ’s shed blood, God puts our transgressions far off from us​—“as far off as the sunrise is from the sunset”—​and restores us to his favor. And think of Jehovah’s provisions in the way of Christian meetings, upbuilding association, shepherds in the congregation, and Bible-based publications we receive through “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>) Do not all these doings of Jehovah help us strengthen our relationship with him? David proclaims: “Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness. . . . He has not done to us even according to our sins; nor according to our errors has he brought upon us what we deserve.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999368/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 103:8-14</a>) Meditating on Jehovah’s loving care can certainly move us to glorify him and magnify his holy name.</p>

<strong>Jehovah’s “Book of Remembrance”</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In the next book of the Bible, Exodus, <span id="page122" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="122" data-before-text="122"></span>we come across the first reference to Jehovah’s “book.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ex. 32:32, 33</a>) Moses speaks of it as an accepted fact and Jehovah does not contradict it, but confirms it. Though no definite word is given as to how Moses got his information, yet for two reasons it is not surprising. First and foremost, all those who died in faith, from Abel onward, had strong confidence that Jehovah would retain each and every one of them in his memory, or, in human language, would keep a permanent record of them, as in a book. Secondly, now that there is evidence indicating that the art of writing goes back to preflood days, it is not surprising that Moses should give expression to his own faith respecting Jehovah’s memory by using the simile of a book written and preserved by its Author. In confirmation of the suggestion already made that Jehovah can and does deliberately forget, as well as remember, we have his own word in this instance: “Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out [not just cross out] of my book.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ex. 32:33</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12. How is the reference to the “Lamb’s scroll of life” seen to be appropriate?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> So from Exodus to Revelation we find quite a few references to a book containing names having Jehovah’s approval and a standing of righteousness before him. Only from the time when the Father “has committed all the judging to the Son” we appropriately read of “the Lamb’s scroll of life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:27</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13. What is made prominent in David’s record and God’s dealings with him?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Next we come to David. Critics are inclined to point the finger of scorn at David and say that his was a very faulty kind of life pattern. True, he had his faults which resulted in serious transgressions at times, but we must be careful not to condemn where Jehovah approves. He was always devoted to the true worship of God and ever dedicated to his service. God found him, as he says, “a man agreeable to my heart, who will do all the things I purpose.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 13:22</a>, <em>NW</em>) While the account does not hide or gloss over David’s faults, yet the main thing made prominent is rather God’s great mercy to his servant. David’s critics would do well to keep this in mind before they find out, too late, their own greater need of mercy. In fact, this aspect of judgment tempered with mercy is so prominent in the scriptures related to our study that it calls for particular attention.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>JUDGMENT TEMPERED WITH MERCY</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">14. What does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Malachi 3:17, 18</a> reveal as to God’s judgment and mercy?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> “I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mal. 3:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) Notice the condition laid down. Jehovah does not spare merely on the grounds of sonship. No, the emphasis is on the proof given of sonship as evidenced by the service rendered. As the prophecy goes on to show, this is how Jehovah makes manifest in this day of judgment those whom he considers righteous (though needing much mercy), and those who are judged as wicked and hence blotted out of his book. Observe the simple, yet searching, test: “Then shall ye . . . discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.” Remember, we are in the day of judgment now.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mal. 3:18</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">15. How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a> closely link Jehovah’s mercy with his memory?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Yes, but how does God spare those sons who cling to his service? Let us turn to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a> and see the close connection between God’s mercy and his memory. First, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps 103 verse 2</a>, there is a call to exercise our own memory: “And forget not all his benefits.” Then, from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 103:8-11</a> verse 8 onward, there comes a glowing description of Jehovah’s mercy and loving-kindness, proved by the fact that “as far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 103:12</a>; see also <span id="page123" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="123" data-before-text="123"></span><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isaiah 12:1</a>.) That means he really forgives and really forgets. Then, similar to Malachi’s reference to a man sparing his own son, this Psalm comfortingly tells us something that Jehovah ever keeps in mind: “Like as a father pitieth his children, so Jehovah pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.” Next comes a striking contrast between the brevity of man’s life, so soon finished in death, and the mercy and loving-kindness of Jehovah which is “from everlasting to everlasting,” shown to those observing the same conditions as Malachi mentions: “Upon them that fear him, . . . to such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his precepts to do them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Mal 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Ps. 103:13, 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954127/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 17, 18</a>, <em>AS.</em></p>

She makes sure that he has bathed and that his clothes are neat and clean. This keeps him healthy and shows others that his parents are taking good care of him. Similarly, our loving Father, Jehovah, wants us to be clean​—both physically and morally. When we are clean, we benefit ourselves and bring honor to him.</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. How can we be physically clean?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">Jehovah tells us: <strong>“You must be holy.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:16</a>) Holiness is related to physical and moral cleanness. We can be physically clean by bathing regularly and by keeping our clothes, home, and vehicle neat and clean. We can also help clean our Kingdom Hall. By keeping physically clean, we bring honor to Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:3, 4</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.

Our thoughts should please Jehovah, so we do our best to reject improper thoughts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 104:34</a>) We also strive to use clean speech.​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8">What else could make us physically or morally unclean? Some substances can contaminate our body. Therefore, we avoid such things as tobacco, the chewing of betel nut or coca leaves, and the recreational use of drugs. By avoiding these, we are healthier and we show respect for the gift of life. We also strive to be morally clean by fighting against the unclean practices of masturbation and of viewing pornography.

<strong>He Remembers That “We Are Dust”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>“As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011566/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Verse 13</a>) David, a father himself, knew what a loving father feels in his heart. Such a father is moved to show compassion to his children, especially when they are in pain. David assures us that our loving heavenly Father shows mercy to his earthly children, especially when their repentant hearts are “broken and crushed” because of their sins.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011566/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 51:17</a>.</p>

She makes sure that he has bathed and that his clothes are neat and clean. This keeps him healthy and shows others that his parents are taking good care of him. Similarly, our loving Father, Jehovah, wants us to be clean​—both physically and morally. When we are clean, we benefit ourselves and bring honor to him.</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. How can we be physically clean?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">Jehovah tells us: <strong>“You must be holy.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:16</a>) Holiness is related to physical and moral cleanness. We can be physically clean by bathing regularly and by keeping our clothes, home, and vehicle neat and clean. We can also help clean our Kingdom Hall. By keeping physically clean, we bring honor to Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:3, 4</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.

Our thoughts should please Jehovah, so we do our best to reject improper thoughts.

Some substances can contaminate our body. Therefore, we avoid such things as tobacco, the chewing of betel nut or coca leaves, and the recreational use of drugs. By avoiding these, we are healthier and we show respect for the gift of life. We also strive to be morally clean by fighting against the unclean practices of masturbation and of viewing pornography.

<strong>‘Jehovah Remembers that We Are Dust’</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span id="page518" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="518" data-before-text="518"></span>On the individual level, Judean King Manasseh is a case in point. He practiced large-scale idolatry and shed much innocent blood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975641/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975641/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 16</a>) The punishment that he deserved was death. However, Jehovah God did not bring upon Manasseh a judgment in proportion to his sin. Manasseh’s discipline consisted of his being taken as a captive to Babylon by the Assyrians. Was that discipline purposeful? Yes, Manasseh repented and humbly prayed to Jehovah to be shown favor. In time Jehovah God gave favorable attention to his pleas and restored him to his kingship. That Manasseh had really changed on account of the discipline received is evident from what he did thereafter. He began a campaign against idolatry, prepared the altar of Jehovah and began sacrificing upon it. Manasseh also encouraged his subjects to serve Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975641/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:12-17</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This example makes it clear that Jehovah God will deal like a merciful father toward those who repent and begin to fear him in a wholesome way. So, regardless of what wrongs a person may commit, he can regain God’s favor if he is truly repentant. Recognizing the repentant wrongdoer’s frailty and transitoriness, Jehovah God will deal compassionately with him. Said the psalmist regarding the Israelites: “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975641/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14</a>.</p>

<strong>The Boundaries of God’s Kingdom</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Perhaps you feel somewhat discouraged, feeling that the standard is too high for you personally. You may say you know yourself only too well. If so, do not forget that Jehovah knows you far better than you do. “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.” Much of the difficulty, even much of the wickedness, is due largely to ignorance of God’s purpose and kindly provisions. Do you recall Paul’s words to the Court of the Areopagus about this? “God has overlooked the times of such ignorance, yet now he is telling mankind that they should <em>all everywhere</em> repent.” This is not an empty statement. The time for ignorance is past; the time for repentance is here. Repeatedly the Scriptures show that in the final analysis, there is not only the matter of individual responsibility, but also the possibility of making an individual choice. Your past record and personality may reveal inherent weaknesses, or even worse things, that you feel cannot be overcome. However, the fact that God has many times appealed even to the wicked shows that no one’s case is hopeless, unless one has willfully opposed God and his standards, with no plea of ignorance or display of repentance. God’s warning and appeal to Cain show that at that time he could have recovered himself, especially if he had asked for help.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973525/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973525/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Acts 17:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973525/31/2" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Gen. 4:6, 7</a>.</p>

<strong>How Can You Be ‘Perfect as Your Heavenly Father Is Perfect’?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Yes, Jehovah mercifully and reasonably took into account the imperfection and disabilities of his earthly servants. A father would not expect of his young son what he would of a full-grown man, would he? Nor would a potter expect the same quality when molding a vase from ordinary clay as he would when forming one from special refined clay. Jehovah God, who is the Great Potter, takes into consideration the inherent weakness of his human servants. For, “as a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isa. 64:8</a>.</p>

<strong>Daily Bread, Forgiveness, and Deliverance</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> But we can weaken ourselves for the trial by a lack of watchfulness and prayerful preparation, by our carelessness and ignoring God’s instructions and advice, so that, under the trial, we will enter into temptation to do sin and will succumb to <span id="page503" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="503" data-before-text="503"></span>it due to the desire which we have cultivated contrary to God’s will. Thus we let it turn out an experience with spiritual hurt to us rather than one of victory for us, one building us up in our strength in God, one strengthening the ‘tested quality of our faith’ and winning God’s approval for us. We should always remember Jesus’ warning, “The spirit, of course, is willing, but the flesh is weak.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Mark 14:38</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Luke 22:40,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 46</a>) Before going to Gethsemane Jesus had warned them that the prophecy he quoted must be fulfilled. Hence the fulfillment of the prophecy was not being forced upon them contrary to their wills. It came true because their flesh was weak and they had not strengthened their willing spirit by keeping awake and praying. They did not avail themselves of the divine help they needed. Consequently they entered into temptation due to a selfish desire to save their own necks, and they fled and abandoned Jesus, and Peter went farther and denied him three times.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">24. How is it shown that God was not the one that brought them into temptation in Gethsemane?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> It was not God that brought them into this temptation so as to fulfill his own prophecy, for God’s Son Jesus stood the trial and he asked for his disciples to be let go unmolested. Their failure to heed Jesus and watch, pray and copy his courageous, self-sacrificing example operated for them to enter into the temptation. Since Jesus stood the trial, God had not brought the apostles into temptation by giving them a trial greater than what they could stand. Jesus’ steadfastness by God’s power should have steadied and helped them. Satan was the one that ‘sifted the apostles like wheat’, scattering them because they feared death with their Master. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Luke 22:31-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Amos 9:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/48/2" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Ps. 59:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/48/3" data-bid="49-4" class="b"> Isa. 30:28</a>) That God did not bring them into this temptation, but that they themselves entered into it, is shown in that later on they did find in God the strength to expose themselves to being arrested for Jesus’ sake, to being thrown into prison and being held for execution. So with Jehovah’s help they could have borne the Gethsemane trial also. Hence it follows that the heavenly Father brought them under trial at Gethsemane but did not bring them into temptation.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">25. So in praying not to be brought into temptation what are we asking of the heavenly Father?

Is that not a proper prayer of a child to its father? We have God’s written guarantee that he will not do so. “For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. Like as a father pitieth his children, so Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.” And he says: “They shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts, even mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Mal. 3:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) Supporting this thought, the apostle Paul vindicates God of any charge of bringing us into temptation by saying: “Let him that thinks he has a firm position beware that he does not fall.

But God is faithful and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:12, 13</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>DELIVERANCE FROM THE WICKED ONE</strong></p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">26.

He does not forget that we are creatures of dust, having frailties, or weaknesses, as a result of imperfection. The expression that he knows “how we are formed” reminds us that the Bible likens Jehovah to a potter and us to the clay vessels he forms. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2-6</a>) The Great Potter tempers his dealings with us according to the frailty of our sinful nature and the way we respond or fail to respond to his guidance.</p>

She makes sure that he has bathed and that his clothes are neat and clean. This keeps him healthy and shows others that his parents are taking good care of him. Similarly, our loving Father, Jehovah, wants us to be clean​—both physically and morally. When we are clean, we benefit ourselves and bring honor to him.</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. How can we be physically clean?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">Jehovah tells us: <strong>“You must be holy.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:16</a>) Holiness is related to physical and moral cleanness. We can be physically clean by bathing regularly and by keeping our clothes, home, and vehicle neat and clean. We can also help clean our Kingdom Hall. By keeping physically clean, we bring honor to Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:3, 4</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.

Our thoughts should please Jehovah, so we do our best to reject improper thoughts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 104:34</a>) We also strive to use clean speech.​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8">What else could make us physically or morally unclean? Some substances can contaminate our body. Therefore, we avoid such things as tobacco, the chewing of betel nut or coca leaves, and the recreational use of drugs. By avoiding these, we are healthier and we show respect for the gift of life. We also strive to be morally clean by fighting against the unclean practices of masturbation and of viewing pornography.

All the elements of which the human body is composed are to be found in the “dust from the ground.” A chemist once claimed that an adult human body is 65 percent oxygen, 18 percent carbon, 10 percent hydrogen, 3 percent nitrogen, 1.5 percent calcium, and 1 percent phosphorus, with the remainder being made up of other elements. Whether these estimates are wholly accurate is unimportant. The fact remains: “We are dust”!</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 2.

God’s works are perfect and without blemish, so his choosing to create man in this way is certainly no cause for complaint. Indeed, that the Grand Creator was able to create man from the dust of the earth in a fear-inspiring and wonderful way increases our appreciation for His unlimited power, skill, and practical wisdom.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, footnote; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 139:14</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>A Change of Circumstances</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 3, 4.

God never intended, however, that these be burdensome or overly restrictive. They were not meant to cause discouragement or to result in unhappiness. Still, as the context of David’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 103:14</a> indicates, limitations to which humans are subject can cause discouragement and result in unhappiness. Why? When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, they brought about a changed situation for their future family. <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>Being made of dust then took on new connotations.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1994642/0">a</a></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> David was speaking, not about the natural limitations that even perfect humans made of dust would have had, but about human frailties caused by inherited imperfection. Otherwise he would not have said of Jehovah: “Him who is forgiving all your error, who is healing all your maladies, who is reclaiming your life from the very pit, [who] has not done to us even according to our sins; nor according to our errors has he brought upon us what we deserve.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 103:2-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Despite being made of dust, had perfect humans remained faithful, they would never have erred, sinned, so as to need forgiveness; nor would they have had maladies requiring healing. Above all, they would never have had to descend into the pit of death from which they could be reclaimed only by means of a resurrection.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. Why is it not difficult for us to understand David’s words?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Being imperfect, all of us have experienced the things of which David spoke. We are constantly aware of our limitations due to imperfection. We are saddened when they at times seem to impair our relationship with Jehovah or with our Christian brothers. We regret that our imperfections and the pressures of Satan’s world occasionally push us into despondency. Since Satan’s rule is rapidly drawing to a close, his world is exerting ever greater pressure on people in general and on Christians in particular.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6.

Some Christians have been heard to remark that the longer they are in the truth the more imperfect they seem to become. More likely, however, it is simply that they have become increasingly aware of their own imperfections and their inability to conform to Jehovah’s perfect standards in the way that they would like. Actually, though, this is likely a consequence of continuing to grow in knowledge and appreciation of Jehovah’s righteous requirements. It is vital that we never allow any such awareness to discourage us to the point of playing into the Devil’s hands. Throughout the centuries he has repeatedly tried to capitalize on discouragement in order to cause Jehovah’s servants to abandon true worship. Nevertheless, genuine love of God, as well as “complete hatred” for the Devil, has prevented most of them from doing so.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 139:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7.

Dissatisfaction with our own achievements could also be a reason. Physical factors or strained relations with family members, friends, or workmates may be involved. Faithful Job became so discouraged that he pleaded with God: “O that in Sheol you would conceal me, that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me!” Now, if difficult circumstances could push Job, “a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad,” to have bouts of discouragement, it is small wonder that the same thing can happen to us.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 2:7-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/8/4" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> 14:13</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8.

He will never cast off those who strive in all sincerity to please him. Occasional discouragement, in fact, may be a positive sign, indicating that we are not taking our service to Jehovah lightly. Viewed from this standpoint, the one who never struggles with discouragement may not be as spiritually aware of his weaknesses as others are of theirs.

We can understand his feelings of inadequacy. He also worried about how fellow Israelites would react: “Suppose they do not believe me and do not listen to my voice?” Jehovah then explained to him how he could prove his authorization, but Moses had another problem.

If we keep on exercising faith, we can be sure that when judgment is rendered in our case, it will be in harmony with the words: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.” What an incentive this gives us to push ahead despite the fact that we are made of dust!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Hebrews 6:10</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>What Does Being Made of Dust Mean for Us Individually?</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">16, 17.

This is in harmony with a Bible principle that Christians have been told to follow: “Let each one prove what his own work is, and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Galatians 6:4</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In harmony with this principle, although Jehovah deals with his people as an organized group, he judges them as individuals. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Romans 14:12</a> says: “Each of us will render an account for himself to God.” Jehovah well knows the genetic makeup of each of his servants. He knows their physical and mental makeup, their abilities, their inherited strengths and weaknesses, the possibilities they have, as well as the extent to which they take advantage of these possibilities to produce Christian fruitage. Jesus’ comments about the widow who dropped two small coins into the temple treasury and his illustration of the seed sown on fine soil are encouraging examples for Christians who may feel depressed because of unwisely comparing themselves with others.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mark 4:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994642/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 12:42-44</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">18.

In making a self-examination, let us never overlook the power of holy spirit in helping us to improve. By means of it, the universe was created, the Bible was written, and, in the midst of a dying world, a peaceful new world society has been <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>brought into existence.

Never should we reason, however, that this is a legitimate excuse for slacking the hand or perhaps even for doing wrong. Not at all!

<strong>‘Jehovah Remembers that We Are Dust’</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This example makes it clear that Jehovah God will deal like a merciful father toward those who repent and begin to fear him in a wholesome way. So, regardless of what wrongs a person may commit, he can regain God’s favor if he is truly repentant. Recognizing the repentant wrongdoer’s frailty and transitoriness, Jehovah God will deal compassionately with him. Said the psalmist regarding the Israelites: “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975641/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14</a>.</p>

You may say you know yourself only too well. If so, do not forget that Jehovah knows you far better than you do. “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.” Much of the difficulty, even much of the wickedness, is due largely to ignorance of God’s purpose and kindly provisions. Do you recall Paul’s words to the Court of the Areopagus about this? “God has overlooked the times of such ignorance, yet now he is telling mankind that they should <em>all everywhere</em> repent.” This is not an empty statement. The time for ignorance is past; the time for repentance is here. Repeatedly the Scriptures show that in the final analysis, there is not only the matter of individual responsibility, but also the possibility of making an individual choice. Your past record and personality may reveal inherent weaknesses, or even worse things, that you feel cannot be overcome. However, the fact that God has many times appealed even to the wicked shows that no one’s case is hopeless, unless one has willfully opposed God and his standards, with no plea of ignorance or display of repentance. God’s warning and appeal to Cain show that at that time he could have recovered himself, especially if he had asked for help.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973525/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973525/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Acts 17:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973525/31/2" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Gen. 4:6, 7</a>.</p>

<strong>How Can You Be ‘Perfect as Your Heavenly Father Is Perfect’?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Yes, Jehovah mercifully and reasonably took into account the imperfection and disabilities of his earthly servants. A father would not expect of his young son what he would of a full-grown man, would he? Nor would a potter expect the same quality when molding a vase from ordinary clay as he would when forming one from special refined clay. Jehovah God, who is the Great Potter, takes into consideration the inherent weakness of his human servants. For, “as a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him.

What should man’s relationship to Jehovah be, and what does Jehovah provide for this?</p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JEHOVAH created man to be dependent on his Maker. While man possessed the great gift of free moral agency, he was not to be independent of Jehovah, but would need to rely on him for further instruction and guidance. Man could not successfully govern or be governed without the assistance and information that come from Jehovah. He must have God in his life in order to be truly happy and to be a blessing to others. Because man was created dependent on Jehovah, it meant that the invisible Jehovah would reveal himself to man to keep him continually informed concerning His purposes and requirements. That Jehovah does reveal himself the prophet Amos made clear when he said: “For the Lord Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964442/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 3:7</a>) His servant Daniel told King Nebuchadnezzar similarly: “However, there exists a God in the heavens who is a Revealer of secrets.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964442/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 2:28</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 2, 3.

Why?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> This revealing of Jehovah’s purposes comes in his own due time. He does not reveal his will all at once, but reveals it progressively down the stream of time, as it is needed by those affected. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964442/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:18</a> says: “But the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Jehovah made man’s mind. Since he designed it, he knows what is best for it far better than the possessor of the mind, man. Jehovah therefore recognizes man’s capacity and limitation to absorb new things. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964442/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 103:14</a> informs us: “For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.” Because of such limitations, including the added burden of human imperfection due to the rebellion in the garden of Eden, Jehovah provides spiritual truths as man is able to absorb them. Are we not thankful for the progressing of the seasons gradually so that our bodies are not shocked by sudden changes in temperature? Jehovah has wisely governed these seasons for man’s benefit. He has made the passing of them gradual so man’s body is able to adapt itself to the change. Man’s mind also needs gradual feeding and changing, as too little will keep it weak spiritually, but too much will not be absorbed and can be shocking. It is like the watering of a tender plant. Too little water will not sustain it, and the plant will gradually wither away and die. Too much water will be beyond the ability of the plant to absorb, and might even hinder its growth.</p>

<strong>Is Experience the Best Teacher?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, it cannot be said that such a test must be experienced to be understood. If so, then Jesus would be wiser in this regard than Jehovah God, for God did not experience it. Yet God understands flesh-and-blood creatures better than they understand themselves: “Like the compassion of a father for his children is the compassion of Yahweh for them who revere him; for he knoweth how we are formed, he is mindful that dust we are.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951085/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. <span id="page89" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="89" data-before-text="89"></span>103:13, 14</a>, <em>Ro</em>) He understood this issue of integrity so well that at the very beginning of it when Satan raised the challenge Jehovah was able to infallibly say that some men would be able to pass the test. Not only Jehovah God, but also Christ understood man’s abilities in this regard, for had he not been used to make man from the dust? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951085/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 1:16</a>) Had he not observed how Job and others successfully passed the test of integrity?

Yet none of the hard experiences they endured as a result of their disobedience, from the time of their ouster from Eden onward, taught them the need to repent and admit their wrong.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In the degradation that followed, human creatures did not learn of their errors in humility, did not learn from the hard knocks of experience, but took more and more bruising falls in the wake of pride and self-exaltation. To this very twentieth century experiences of their own or of others have failed to teach them to avoid the snare of pride; on the contrary, the heady and high-minded among men increase in these last days. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951085/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951085/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Why, some arrogant few even match Satan’s folly by exalting themselves above Jehovah, pretending that they daily order God from his heavenly throne down to earth to be sacrificed by them on a religious altar!</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Men of years with all their accumulated experience are not necessarily the ones who are wise. The young and comparatively inexperienced Elihu waited in vain to hear wisdom from Job’s three aged “friends”, and finally in indignation spoke out bluntly against them: “I am of few days, while you are aged; therefore I feared and was afraid to show you my knowledge. I thought days should speak, and many years should teach wisdom. However, it is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty, that makes them intelligent; it is not the old that are wise, nor the elders who understand justice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951085/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 32:6-9</a>, <em>AT</em>) Whether Elihu thought “years should teach wisdom” <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>because of the experience they made possible, or whether he thought passing years would mean wisdom because they would allow time for much study, is not made clear by the account. What is clear is that Elihu discerned the need more vital than either of these, when he said, “Yet surely there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.” (<em>Ro</em>) He realized that neither experience nor years of study would bring true wisdom, unless accompanied by Jehovah’s spirit.</p>

Thus we let it turn out an experience with spiritual hurt to us rather than one of victory for us, one building us up in our strength in God, one strengthening the ‘tested quality of our faith’ and winning God’s approval for us. We should always remember Jesus’ warning, “The spirit, of course, is willing, but the flesh is weak.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Mark 14:38</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Luke 22:40,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 46</a>) Before going to Gethsemane Jesus had warned them that the prophecy he quoted must be fulfilled. Hence the fulfillment of the prophecy was not being forced upon them contrary to their wills. It came true because their flesh was weak and they had not strengthened their willing spirit by keeping awake and praying. They did not avail themselves of the divine help they needed. Consequently they entered into temptation due to a selfish desire to save their own necks, and they fled and abandoned Jesus, and Peter went farther and denied him three times.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">24. How is it shown that God was not the one that brought them into temptation in Gethsemane?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> It was not God that brought them into this temptation so as to fulfill his own prophecy, for God’s Son Jesus stood the trial and he asked for his disciples to be let go unmolested. Their failure to heed Jesus and watch, pray and copy his courageous, self-sacrificing example operated for them to enter into the temptation. Since Jesus stood the trial, God had not brought the apostles into temptation by giving them a trial greater than what they could stand. Jesus’ steadfastness by God’s power should have steadied and helped them. Satan was the one that ‘sifted the apostles like wheat’, scattering them because they feared death with their Master. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Luke 22:31-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Amos 9:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/48/2" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Ps. 59:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/48/3" data-bid="49-4" class="b"> Isa. 30:28</a>) That God did not bring them into this temptation, but that they themselves entered into it, is shown in that later on they did find in God the strength to expose themselves to being arrested for Jesus’ sake, to being thrown into prison and being held for execution. So with Jehovah’s help they could have borne the Gethsemane trial also. Hence it follows that the heavenly Father brought them under trial at Gethsemane but did not bring them into temptation.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">25.

Is that not a proper prayer of a child to its father? We have God’s written guarantee that he will not do so. “For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. Like as a father pitieth his children, so Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.” And he says: “They shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts, even mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Mal. 3:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) Supporting this thought, the apostle Paul vindicates God of any charge of bringing us into temptation by saying: “Let him that thinks he has a firm position beware that he does not fall.

Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God.

How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? Are your days like the days of mortal man, or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man?” “As one trifles with mortal man will you trifle with [God]? “ “God is much more than mortal man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 33:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">From his prayers we can see that David had a like keen appreciation: “Do arise, O Jehovah!

Worn columns, crumbling walls and jumbled stones are all that remain of it. Its aged ruins stand among modern buildings and paved streets as mute reminders of the people who once walked its streets but who are now part of its dust.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Those people were not too different from us today. They had their homes, their families, their businesses and their pleasures. They had the same physical and emotional feelings and had their plans and hopes just as we have. But like the flowers that now sprout among the ruins of their city and then fade, so they lived a short while and then ceased to be. “As for mortal man, his days are like those of green grass; like a blossom of the field is the way he blossoms forth. For a mere wind has to pass over it, and it is no more.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958000/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 103:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But why must man’s life be like a fading flower? Why can it not be like a flower that never fades? Why can it not last a long time, like the sturdy sequoia tree? It can and it will. The One who created man purposed that it should when he placed the first human pair in a peaceful garden like beautiful flowers. It was man’s own willful disobedience that caused things to be different. Because man brought death upon himself it does not mean that God’s purposes failed. They never fail. “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958000/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 55:11</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Through undeserved kindness God provided the means for man to regain what the first pair lost.

<strong>Divine Rulership—Over Mankind at the Start</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Jehovah himself has firmly established his throne in the very heavens; and over everything his own kingship has held domination.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 103:19</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 1. What, according to our meaning, is the “establishment” into which we were all born, and what estimate must we make of it?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WE WERE all born into an “establishment.” By that word do we mean the system of things that exists here on our earthly globe? No! We mean an establishment of which our earth is just a very tiny part. We mean an establishment that extends away out into outer space. It takes in more than the Milky Way galaxy of which our sun is merely one of many like suns. It takes in all the galaxies of stars that the greatest man-made telescopes have been able to bring to human view. So tremendously big is this establishment that it needs to be measured in units of distance called “light-years.” Regardless of its hugeness, everybody has to admit that it is a marvelous establishment. It was already here before ever protesting youth of today got here, or before ever mankind got started here. All of us were brought into this establishment, not by our own will or choice. So, is this establishment something to protest about?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 2. Why could it not be that man is responsible for running this “establishment,” and what does our reason dictate as to the runner of it?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Who runs this staggeringly large establishment? It was already operating orderly before we humans came into existence. It does not need us to keep it running forever, hanging out there in space and working so harmoniously. Needless to say, it is too big for us, too far beyond our power of influence to reach. We cannot control it from here on earth with missiles, spaceships or radar systems. This is no chance establishment. If we were to calculate scientifically, it would be a case of trillions upon trillions of reasons against one bare possibility that such a harmonious, highly organized, perfectly operating “establishment” came about by accident, by chance. It could not come from nothing, for something never comes from nothing. Such a mighty concentration of dynamic energy as this establishment has in itself could never come from a hollow vacuum, from emptiness. According to our reasoning powers with which we have been gifted, it had to come from a central, inexhaustible source of power and energy. And that “source” would have to be intelligent, having know-how besides almighty ability. It must run the establishment.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 3. (a) What must we conclude as to the runner of this visible “establishment,” and what is a suitable name for such? (b) What is the title as given in the Holy Bible?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> We do not want to act “dumb,” do we? That is to say, stupid, senseless, unreasonable, which also means, unscientific? There is nothing else for reasoning, intelligent humans to accept but that the great Runner of this amazing “establishment” of beauty, design and power is an intelligent Person, even though invisible to our frail natural eyes. Does any of us have a better title by which to call that Person than “God”? <span id="page646" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="646" data-before-text="646"></span>That is what the Greatest Book on earth calls that Person. And this it does in its very opening sentence, saying: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” In the original language in which this part of the Book was written the word for our English word “God” is <em>Elohimʹ.</em> As <em>The Holy Name Bible,</em> which utterly rejects the title “God,” puts the sentence in English: “In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>) This same Creator of the heavens and the earth takes the responsibility for that Book of all books, the Holy Bible, and from the first to the last this Book of more than a thousand pages reveals this intelligent Creator to be a God of perfect activity, of perfect wisdom, justice, love and power. He is perfectly able to run this visible “establishment.”</p>

The Bible records Jesus’ own statement that “the Father is greater than I am.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 14:28</a>) In fact, the more closely we look into the matter the more evident it becomes that Christ, even though king, occupies a position subordinate to his Father, Jehovah God.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH THE SOVEREIGN RULER</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Following Jesus’ death, the same apostles whom he had taught to pray, later addressed his Father in this way: “Sovereign Lord, you are the One who made the heaven and the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 4:24</a>, <em>NW; Mo; RS.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">As they acknowledged, Jehovah is the Universal <em>Sovereign.</em> What does this mean? “Sovereign” means much more than merely the ruler or head of a government. It means the one who is the <em>source</em> of all right to rule, the one in whom all authority justly resides. Jehovah legitimately holds this position over all others by virtue of his Godship and because he is the Creator of all that exists. The psalmist sang of him: “Jehovah himself has firmly established his throne in the very heavens; and over everything his own kingship has held domination.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 103:19</a>) Unlike those heads of earthly governments today whose executive power is balanced by and limited through a separate legislature and a separate judiciary, Jehovah is not limited in his authority. For that reason the prophet wrote of him: “Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Statute-giver, Jehovah is our King; he himself will save us.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 33:22</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Without stepping down or in any way diminishing his own position as the Sovereign Ruler, Jehovah can, nevertheless, delegate <span id="page134" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>authority and grant power to others, appointing them to carry out his will. Because he always remains King over all such ones, it can be said to him: “Your kingship is a kingship for all times indefinite, and your dominion is throughout all successive generations.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 145:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">All things considered in the light of the Scriptures, it is straining the point to argue that God has no organization in view of the fact that the original words meaning “organization” in ancient languages do not occur in the inspired Hebrew and Greek Scriptures. In everything God demonstrates that he has the ability to organize. What would happen if he did not organize his obedient creatures? As a structure an organization is a body of intelligent persons who are brought together and arranged so as to work peacefully and harmoniously together in carrying out a common purpose, the purpose of the organizer.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In line with this fact, God is repeatedly called “Jehovah of armies.” An army is an organized body of troops. So, in support of the truth that God has an organization, we read the following exhortation addressed to his organization: “Bless Jehovah, O you angels of his, mighty in power, carrying out his word, by listening to the voice of his word. Bless Jehovah, all you armies of his, you ministers of his, doing his will. Bless Jehovah, all you his works, in all places of his domination.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981330/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 103:20-22</a>) Jehovah had an organization of heavenly spirit creatures before ever he created our earth and put man upon it.</p>

It was the pleasures of sex that caused <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>certain angels to leave their heavenly positions in Noah’s day. Also, they communicate with each other by means of the speech or ‘tongues of angels.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 22:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:1</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Angels being spirit creatures, it is not possible for humans to know what they look like. In dealing with humans, angels at times appeared in human form and on occasion as winged creatures. Then again, to call attention to their honorable office, a physical glory and brilliance may be associated with them, they appearing as bright as lightning.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Dan. 10:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:3</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">In common with man, angels are free moral agents, that is, they can choose to do right or wrong. They are intelligent creatures that can worship God Jehovah or refuse to do so and take the consequences. Some of them have rebelled against God, chief of whom is their prince Beelzebub, Satan the Devil. Those who have continued faithful are termed “holy angels” and share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, even as do faithful humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Matt. 12:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Mark 8:38</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Since God created man ‘a little less than the angels,’ angels doubtless have greater mental capacity than does man, and yet there are some things that God has kept from them. Thus Jesus said that the angels did not know the day or hour when the wicked heavens and earth would be destroyed. And Peter tells us that there were certain things that angels were desirous of peering into. They must be keenly interested in what is going on upon the earth, for they are said to rejoice at the repentance of a sinner and to watch the “theatrical spectacle” furnished by Christians. More than that, it is reasonable to conclude that angels can learn from observing Christians, for women in the Christian congregation are told to wear a sign of authority upon their heads because of the angels, so as to set the angels a proper example of submission to God-appointed rule.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 24:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Luke 15:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/21/3" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 4:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/21/4" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> 11:10</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In keeping with their exalted position are the superhuman powers with which angels are endowed. In harmony with this we read that the Lord Jesus Christ will be revealed “from heaven with his powerful angels.” “Bless Jehovah, O you angels of his, mighty in power, carrying out his word.” And their power is implied by the deeds they are said to have performed, such as two of them destroying Sodom and Gomorrah and one of them slaying the Assyrian host of 185,000 warriors encamped before Jerusalem in the days of King Hezekiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ps. 103:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/22/2" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Gen. 19:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/22/3" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:35</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">We may also safely conclude that angels, God’s spirit messengers, travel at tremendous speeds. Thus once when Daniel began to pray, God dispatched an angel to him in answer to his prayer. This angel, although coming from beyond the realms of outer space, reached Daniel before he had concluded his prayer.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Dan. 9:21</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>DUTIES AND PRIVILEGES</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">It might be argued, as the modernists do, that there is no need for a ladder of angels leading from earth to heaven as Jacob saw in his dream. God could well accomplish his purposes by other means. But Jehovah God simply has not chosen to do so. He also could have created everything himself, even as by himself he brought forth his only-begotten Son, the Word, later to be known as Jesus Christ. But God chose to let his Son serve as the active agent in the creation of all other creatures and things, thereby giving his Son much pleasure as well as receiving joy himself as he noted his Son’s dutiful course. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 8:22-30</a>) This wise course Jehovah also pursued with the angels. They are not indispensable, <span id="page59" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>but God has seen fit to create them for the purpose of giving them happiness and to serve his purposes in carrying out his will for them.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">All things considered in the light of the Scriptures, it is straining the point to argue that God has no organization in view of the fact that the original words meaning “organization” in ancient languages do not occur in the inspired Hebrew and Greek Scriptures. In everything God demonstrates that he has the ability to organize. What would happen if he did not organize his obedient creatures? As a structure an organization is a body of intelligent persons who are brought together and arranged so as to work peacefully and harmoniously together in carrying out a common purpose, the purpose of the organizer.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In line with this fact, God is repeatedly called “Jehovah of armies.” An army is an organized body of troops. So, in support of the truth that God has an organization, we read the following exhortation addressed to his organization: “Bless Jehovah, O you angels of his, mighty in power, carrying out his word, by listening to the voice of his word. Bless Jehovah, all you armies of his, you ministers of his, doing his will. Bless Jehovah, all you his works, in all places of his domination.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981330/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 103:20-22</a>) Jehovah had an organization of heavenly spirit creatures before ever he created our earth and put man upon it.</p>

The ancient psalmist was inspired to say: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, you have proved very great. With dignity and splendor you have clothed yourself, enwrapping yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent cloth, the One building his upper chambers with beams in the very waters, making the clouds his chariot, walking upon the wings of the wind, making his angels spirits, his ministers a devouring fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971003/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 104:1-4</a>) Of course, Jehovah does not make the literal clouds of earth his chariot, but he can use them as his agencies for doing certain things to or for mankind on earth. What Ezekiel saw in vision resembled a four-wheeled chariot more than clouds do. Jehovah did not inspire Ezekiel to envision that celestial chariot just to entertain him with something fantastic in appearance. He showed Ezekiel that unusual, self-propelling chariot as a picture of something still greater. There is profit for us in knowing what it signifies.</p><p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">29, 30.

What? The heavenly organization of Jehovah as composed of all his holy spirit creatures in that invisible realm. By the appearance of the four cherubic living creatures that had symbolic features and that accompanied the four wheels like chariot runners, we are reminded of what the psalmist David wrote, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971003/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 18:6-10</a>:</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> “In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, and to my God I kept crying for help.

We cannot but be impressed with the majesty, the creative skill, the productive ability of the One who is our Maker. The psalmist too was impressed, for he wrote: “O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honor and majesty: . . . who stretched it out the heavens like a curtain; . . . who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved for ever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 104:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 5</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 2, 3.

At night countless heavenly objects that, to the unaided eye, appear as jewels are stars like our sun, some larger, some smaller. Each may be the center of a planetary system similar to that of which our earth is a part. At one time it was thought all stars were the same distance from the earth, but now astronomers show that space extends on and on; and with powerful telescopes distant regions of the universe are brought into view—whole hosts of formerly unknown stars. What to man’s naked eye may appear to be a single star, through a telescope is seen to be a cluster of stars or galaxy. In fact, so vast is the universe that astronomers have come to refer to these galaxies as “island universes.” Man’s most powerful telescope has brought within his vision’s range literally billions of galaxies.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Some local facts may further sharpen your appreciation. We live in a huge “island universe” of billions of stars. Most of it we cannot see because of great dust clouds in space, but now it is known to be of wheellike shape, with spokes or spirals gyrating out from a hublike center. All of it that we see men call the Milky Way—one of the spirals, made up of millions of stars with our sun among them. Many though the stars may be, there is plenty of room; for our nearest star-neighbor is said to be twenty-five trillion miles away. Space distances are so great they are measured in light years. The distance light travels in a year (or six trillion miles) is the unit. Using this measure we gain some <span id="page722" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="722" data-before-text="722"></span>idea of the size of our home galaxy, for it takes light from a star located on the outer rim a hundred thousand years to reach the outer rim on the other side; no small distance. Yet such a tremendous creative work is dwarfed by the fact that, to other galaxies, billions of light years distant, it all appears as a single star. Little wonder that Jehovah inspired his prophet Isaiah to write: “‘To whom, then, would you liken me, that I should be equal,’ says the Holy One.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 40:25</a>, <em>AT.</em></p>

<strong>Honor Jehovah by Displaying Dignity</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> How the God-fearing psalmist must have been touched when he beheld the quiet grandeur of the starry night sky, studded with glistening “jewels”! Filled with wonder at how God ‘has stretched out the heavens like a tent cloth,’ the psalmist represented Jehovah as clothed in dignity because of His magnificent creative skill. (<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008605/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 104:1, 2</em></a><em>.</em>) The dignity and splendor of the invisible, almighty Creator are evident in his visible works.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">7, 8.

Astronomers estimate that the Milky Way may be one of anywhere from 50 billion to as many as 125 billion galaxies. How many stars are there in the entire universe? The answer surely is mind-boggling. Yet, Jehovah “is counting the number of the stars; all of them he calls by their names.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008605/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 147:4</a>) Upon seeing Jehovah clothed in such dignity and splendor, are you not moved to extol his great name?</p>

Unlike God’s eternal existence, the permanence of any part of his physical creation is not independent. As seen in the earth, the physical creation must undergo a continual renewing process if it is to endure or retain its existing form. That the physical heavens are dependent on God’s will and sustaining power is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/118/0" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>, where, after referring to sun, moon and stars, along with other parts of God’s creation, verse six states that God “keeps them standing forever, to time indefinite.

This is because God’s only-begotten Son was God’s personal Agent employed in creating the physical universe. Paul contrasts the Son’s permanence with that of the physical creation, which God, if he so designed, could ‘wrap up just as a cloak’ and set it aside.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/120/0" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Heb. 1:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/120/1" data-bid="121-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/120/2" data-bid="121-3" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="ss"><strong>VARIOUS POETIC AND FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Because the physical heavens play a vital part in sustaining and prospering life on earth—by sunshine, rain, dew, refreshing winds, and other atmospheric benefits—they are spoken of poetically as Jehovah’s “good storehouse.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/121/0" data-bid="122-1" class="b">Deut. 28:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/121/1" data-bid="122-2" class="b"> 33:13, 14</a>) Jehovah opens its “doors” to bless his servants, as when causing manna, “the grain of heaven,” to descend upon the ground.

Having foretold the devastating results of Israel’s unfaithfulness, Jehovah now tells of the time of her restoration and the resulting blessings. In that day, he says, “I shall answer the heavens, and they, for their part, will answer the earth; and the earth, for its part, will answer the grain and the sweet wine and the oil; and they, for their part, will answer Jezreel.” Evidently this represents Israel’s petition for Jehovah’s blessing as being routed through the chain of things of Jehovah’s creation here named. For that reason these things are viewed as personified; hence, as if able to make a request or petition. Israel asks for grain, wine and oil; these products, in turn, seek their plant food and water from the earth; the earth, in order to supply this need, requires (or figuratively calls for) sun, rain and dew from the heavens; and the heavens (till now “shut up” due to the withdrawal of God’s blessing) can respond only if God accepts the petition and restores his favor to the nation, thereby putting the productive cycle in motion. The prophecy gives the assurance that he will do so.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/126/0" data-bid="127-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:8-15</a> David apparently uses the figure of a tremendous storm to represent the effect of God’s intervention on David’s behalf, freeing him from his enemies. The fierceness of this symbolic storm agitates the foundation of the heavens and they ‘bend down’ with dark low-lying clouds.

Thus, when Moses called on the “heavens and the earth” to serve as witnesses to the things that he declared to Israel, it is obvious that he did not mean the inanimate creation but, rather, the intelligent residents inhabiting the heavens and the earth.

Nor did Elijah upon death ascend to the spiritual heavens, since Jesus, while on earth, clearly stated that “no man has ascended into heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/141/0" data-bid="142-1" class="b">John 3:13</a>) At Pentecost Peter likewise said of David that he “did not ascend to the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Acts 2:34</a>) In reality, there is nothing in the Scriptures to show that a heavenly hope was held out to God’s servants prior to the coming of Christ Jesus.

<strong>Does a Great Heavenly Organization Exist?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>WHAT THE CHARIOT SYMBOLIZES</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">We are not to assume that Jehovah sits on a literal throne or rides a literal chariot. To illustrate this fact, we find the psalmist using different symbols to portray the same thing:</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, you have proved very great. With dignity and splendor you have clothed yourself, enwrapping yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent cloth, the One building his upper chambers with beams in the very waters, making the clouds his chariot, walking upon the wings of the wind, making his angels spirits, his ministers a devouring fire.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 104:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The symbolism here used throws light on Ezekiel’s chariot picture. Jehovah does not ride on literal clouds or walk upon the wind any more than he rides in a chariot. But he does use these natural phenomena at times as his agencies for doing certain things for mankind on earth. So the chariot represents something that Jehovah guides, directs and uses toward mankind. Just as the articles of furniture in the tabernacle and in Jehovah’s temple at Jerusalem were designed exactly according to his pattern to picture spiritual things of far greater importance, so with the chariot.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 8:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 28:11, 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 19</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">What, then, does the chariot picture or represent symbolically? Jehovah’s heavenly organization, composed of all the holy spirit creatures, angels, in that heavenly realm. In Ezekiel’s vision, cherubs accompanied the chariot, just as ancient kings had chariot runners. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:5</a>) David portrayed Jehovah’s use of these angels to help his people when he wrote: “In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, and to my God I kept crying for help. Out of his temple he proceeded to hear my voice, and my own cry before him for help now came into his ears. . . . And he proceeded to bend the heavens down and descend. And thick gloom was beneath his feet.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ A young man in the Philippine Islands became the only one in his family to accept the truth about God’s kingdom. When he became one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he soon faced severe opposition from his wife. He stated: “The opposition was so fierce at times that I felt I could not go on, but I was strengthened by scriptures such as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965408/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 12:21</a>: ‘Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.’</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“After my dedication and baptism my wife’s hatred of the Bible truths as taught by the Witnesses became more intense. When she saw me regularly attending congregational meetings and sharing in ministerial activity, she told me that if I did not stop attending the meetings she would go to the Kingdom Hall and cause a scene in front of all the other Witnesses to embarrass me. Still I did not retaliate or get angry but showed a loving attitude and continued my service to Jehovah.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“During the next few months my wife did her best to hinder my ministerial work. She refused to wash and iron my clothes or to prepare my food when I was going out in the field ministry. Instead of repaying her in the same way, I remembered the scripture in Romans and showed her even more loving consideration than ever before. I helped her in home duties and did not complain when I had to prepare my own food and clothes. As a result of this loving attitude, she began to realize that I was practicing right Christian conduct and she changed her entire attitude. Now she cooperates in helping me prepare for meetings and is happy that I am serving Jehovah. You can imagine my joy at this time to see her studying the Bible along with me.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"></p>

(<em>RS, JP, AT, JB</em>) Such translation of the Hebrew text is not inadmissible (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps 148:8</a>); however, the apostle Paul’s quotation of the text (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb 1:7</a>) coincides with that of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and harmonizes with the rendering first given. (In the Greek text of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:7</a>, the definite article [<em>tous</em>] is used before “angels,” not before “spirits [<em>pneuʹma·ta</em>],” making the angels the subject being discussed.) <em>Barnes’ Notes on the New Testament</em> (1974) says: “It is to be presumed that [Paul], who had been trained in the knowledge of the Hebrew language, would have had a better opportunity of knowing its [referring to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 104:4</a>] fair construction than we can; and it is morally certain, that he would employ the passage <em>in an argument</em> as it was commonly understood by those to whom he wrote​—that is, to those who were familiar with the Hebrew language and literature.”​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb 1:14</a>.</p>

The word “spirit,” though, can also mean “wind” or “active force.” God can thus use his angels as powerful forces to carry out his will. They can also be used as executional agents​—as “a devouring fire.” It is reassuring to Christians to know that their preaching work is backed by such powerful angelic creatures.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986928/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Revelation 14:6, 7</a>.</p>

Rather, the understanding involves the underlying meaning of “spirit.” The original words rendered “spirit” (Hebrew, <em>ruahh;</em> Greek, <em>pneuma)</em> have the basic meaning of “to breathe or blow.” Depending on the context, they can be rendered “wind” or “active force.” Hence, the point of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983249/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:7 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983249/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Psalm 104:4</a> evidently is that God makes his invisible angels to be spirit forces or powerful forces in his service. He also can use them as “a flame of fire,” or, “a devouring fire,” when employing them to carry out his fiery judgments.</p>

He did not transfer human creatures of flesh, blood and bones from our earth to keep him company in the invisible heavenly realm. To describe what kind of persons God created directly in heaven, the Christian apostle Paul writes: “He makes his angels spirits, and his public servants a flame of fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:7</a>) Here the apostle Paul was quoting <span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>the psalmist David when he speaks of Jehovah God as “making his angels spirits, his ministers a devouring fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 104:4</a>) Accordingly, the testimony of God’s own written Word is that he has power to create spirit creatures as well as human creatures.</p>

<strong>Does a Great Heavenly Organization Exist?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>WHAT THE CHARIOT SYMBOLIZES</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">We are not to assume that Jehovah sits on a literal throne or rides a literal chariot. To illustrate this fact, we find the psalmist using different symbols to portray the same thing:</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, you have proved very great. With dignity and splendor you have clothed yourself, enwrapping yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent cloth, the One building his upper chambers with beams in the very waters, making the clouds his chariot, walking upon the wings of the wind, making his angels spirits, his ministers a devouring fire.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 104:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The symbolism here used throws light on Ezekiel’s chariot picture. Jehovah does not ride on literal clouds or walk upon the wind any more than he rides in a chariot. But he does use these natural phenomena at times as his agencies for doing certain things for mankind on earth. So the chariot represents something that Jehovah guides, directs and uses toward mankind. Just as the articles of furniture in the tabernacle and in Jehovah’s temple at Jerusalem were designed exactly according to his pattern to picture spiritual things of far greater importance, so with the chariot.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 8:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 28:11, 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 19</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">What, then, does the chariot picture or represent symbolically? Jehovah’s heavenly organization, composed of all the holy spirit creatures, angels, in that heavenly realm. In Ezekiel’s vision, cherubs accompanied the chariot, just as ancient kings had chariot runners. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:5</a>) David portrayed Jehovah’s use of these angels to help his people when he wrote: “In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, and to my God I kept crying for help. Out of his temple he proceeded to hear my voice, and my own cry before him for help now came into his ears. . . . And he proceeded to bend the heavens down and descend. And thick gloom was beneath his feet. And he came riding upon a cherub and came flying, and he came darting upon the wings of a spirit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 18:6-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 22:7-11</a>.</p>

What Ezekiel saw in vision resembled a four-wheeled chariot more than clouds do. Jehovah did not inspire Ezekiel to envision that celestial chariot just to entertain him with something fantastic in appearance. He showed Ezekiel that unusual, self-propelling chariot as a picture of something still greater. There is profit for us in knowing what it signifies.</p><p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">29, 30.

By the appearance of the four cherubic living creatures that had symbolic features and that accompanied the four wheels like chariot runners, we are reminded of what the psalmist David wrote, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971003/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 18:6-10</a>:</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> “In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, and to my God I kept crying for help.

After Noah and his household came out of the ark high up on a mountain’s top in Ararat, God said to Noah and his household while at their altar of worship:</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> “My rainbow I do give in the cloud, and it must serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.

<strong>Does the Bible Teach What You Believe?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Take the belief called universal salvation. Does the Bible teach that all persons will be saved despite their course of action? Let Jesus Christ answer: “He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life.” There is a penalty for willfully ignoring and disobeying the revealed will of God. That is why the Lord Jesus, at God’s war of Armageddon, “brings due punishment upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good <span id="page230" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="230" data-before-text="230"></span>news about our Lord Jesus. These very ones will pay the penalty of everlasting destruction.” No, the Bible does not teach universal salvation but, rather, that those who gain everlasting life must not only exercise faith in the Lord Jesus but also be his obedient followers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 3:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 1:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Tithing is a widely accepted belief in Christendom, churches tithing parishioners ten percent of their income. Does the Bible teach this as a Christian doctrine? Tithing was part of the Law of Moses. But Christians are not under that Law, as Christ’s apostle writes: “You are not under law but under undeserved kindness.” When sending his disciples out to preach, Jesus did not instruct them to tithe people. He said: “You received free, give free.” The Christian way to raise funds for God’s work is by voluntary contributions. A need is made known and then Christians voluntarily give. There must be no compulsion, no pressure, as Paul says: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 6:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matt. 10:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 9:7</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Does the Bible teach the widespread belief that the planet earth will someday be destroyed? When the Bible speaks of the end of the world, it is not referring to the end of the planet earth, but rather to the end of this system of things. A world once came to an end in Noah’s day. The earth that was destroyed then was not this planet but the wicked human society of that time. Wrote the apostle Peter: “There were heavens in ancient times and an earth standing compactly out of water and in the midst of water by the word of God, and by those means the world of that time suffered destruction when it was deluged with water. But by the same word the heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire and are being reserved to the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men.” To destroy the society of ungodly men, God does not need to destroy this planet, as he proved in Noah’s day. Of the planet earth the inspired psalmist wrote: “He has founded the earth upon its established places; it will not be made to totter to time indefinite, nor forever.” True Bible belief is that “the meek ones themselves will possess the earth” and that the earth will become a global paradise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ps. 104:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 37:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Luke 23:43</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>IMAGES AND IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">What of the belief that images are aids to Christian worship? A careful study of the Bible and history shows that the early Christians carefully avoided the use of images. Says the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica,</em> Vol. XII, page 750 (1907 edition): “It was a common accusation brought against Christians by their enemies that they had ‘no altars, no temples, no known images’; and that ‘they set up no image or form of any god’, and this charge was never denied.” To justify the use of images by saying that the honor given them is only relative is not supported by the Bible. God told the Israelites not to bow down to any image. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lev. 26:1</a>) When the Israelites worshiped the golden calf at Sinai, they intended to make an improvement in their religion. They said: “There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.” God did not approve the use of an image in proper worship. Had it not been for Moses’ entreaty Jehovah would have destroyed the entire nation of Israel. Bible principles rule out the belief that images are a Christian aid to worship. Said Jesus: “God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 32:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960281/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 4:24</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">What of the belief so widespread in <span id="page231" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="231" data-before-text="231"></span>Christendom—the immortality of the soul? It is popularly accepted, but does the Bible teach this belief? Commenting on the fact that the Hebrew Scriptures do not teach this doctrine, historian John Lord writes in <em>Beacon Lights of History:</em> “This fact is so remarkable, that some trace to the sages of Greece and Egypt the doctrine itself, as ordinarily understood; that is, a <em>necessary</em> existence of the soul after death. And they fortify themselves with those declarations of the apostles which represent a happy immortality as the special gift of God,—not a necessary existence. . . . If immortality be not a gift, but a necessary existence, as Socrates supposed, it seems strange that heathen philosophers should have speculated more profoundly than the patriarchs of the East on this mysterious subject. We cannot suppose that Plato was more profoundly instructed on such a subject than Abraham and Moses.”</p>

The same was said of the law covenant, but it came to an end.—R. S., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew word translated “forever” in most translations, and “to time indefinite” in the <em>New World Translation,</em> is <em>ʽolamʹ</em>. Its basic meaning is “hidden” or “concealed” and relates to time. Hence it means “time indefinite.” It may mean many years or it may mean eternity. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 31:16 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Leviticus 24:8</a> use it concerning a part of the law covenant and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 21:5</a> uses it concerning the entire law covenant, calling it “the everlasting covenant.” (<em>AV</em>) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Numbers 25:13</a> uses it when speaking of “an everlasting priesthood.” (<em>AV</em>) But <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 3:24, 25 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Colossians 2:14</a> show the law covenant ended with Christ’s death and resurrection, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews chapter 7</a> shows an ending to the law and the “everlasting priesthood.” This time period was concealed, but it had an end.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>ʽOlamʹ</em> may mean eternity, as is apparent when it is used where Jehovah is called “the everlasting God,” and spoken of as being “from everlasting to everlasting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 21:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Isa. 40:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Ps. 90:2</a>, <em>AV</em>) It is used to depict Jehovah as the “king of eternity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 10:10</a>, <em>Da; AV,</em> margin) Hence, as Gesenius’ <em>Hebrew and English Lexicon</em> says, the word indicates “time future, ever, forever, evermore, in such a way that the <em>terminus ad quem</em> [end to which] as it is called is to be determined from the nature of the subject.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">So it is “from the nature of the subject” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a> that we must determine whether <em>ʽolamʹ</em> as there used means to a concealed but limited time or to eternity. The text reads: “A generation is going and a generation is coming, but the earth is standing even to time indefinite.” Jehovah made the earth as man’s home. He made man to live, not die. Death was the penalty of disobedience. As long as the perfect man obeyed he would live, even forever if forever obedient. Even after sin and death entered, obedient men who exercise faith in Christ have the promise of everlasting life on earth: “The meek ones themselves will possess the earth.” Jesus said: “Everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all.” To know Jehovah and Christ “means everlasting life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> John 11:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 17:3</a>) Jehovah God “formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 45:18</a>, <em>AV</em>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">He made the earth to be inhabited by obedient men who would live forever; so the earth must remain forever as their home, else its creation would be in vain. This is made sure by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 104:5</a>. For emphasis two Hebrew words are used, <em>ʽolamʹ</em> and <em>ʽad</em>. The latter means, according to Harkavy’s <em>Students’ Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary,</em> “duration, everlastingness, eternity, for ever.” So by both these Hebrew words <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957889/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 104:5</a> makes doubly sure the earth’s permanence: “He has founded the earth upon its established places; it will not be made to totter to time indefinite, nor forever.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

She did some interesting research on zebras. “The stripes distort the shape and unity of the zebras’ contour so much that even sharp-eyed natives are often unaware of their presence when just 130 to 160 feet <strong>[40-50 m]</strong> away. The zebras’ keen senses of sight and smell as well as their ability to run swiftly—even more than 35 miles per hour <strong>[60 km/hr]</strong>—serve as a protection against carnivorous animals. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996165/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 104:11</a> notes, zebras ‘regularly quench their thirst.’ That is why they are seldom found more than five miles <strong>[8 km]</strong> from water.” Then she added: “We too must regularly quench our spiritual thirst by staying close to the congregation, studying the Bible, and attending meetings.”</p>

<strong>Accepting the Invitation to the Banquet</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In order to lift the condemnation of sin from mankind and remove its penalty death Jehovah God had his Son die sacrificially on earth as the perfect man Jesus Christ. He died childless, thus sacrificing even his right to become father to a perfect human race on earth. Long ago miraculous food sustained the life of his earthly nation for forty years when they traveled through a wilderness. Hence Jesus compared his <span id="page244" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>perfect sacrifice to such food. He said: “I am the bread of life. . . . I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and, for a fact, the bread that I shall give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 6:48-51</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 5.

They have to accept God’s reigning Son, Jesus Christ, as their King, and they have to give him unwavering loyalty and obedience. They must do this by faith.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6. (a) Why would feeding on the “bread of life” be, in itself, a banquet?

What banquet on earth today, no matter how rich in many dishes, gives the banqueters everlasting life? But those who bow to God’s kingdom in the hands of his Son will do more than eat by means of faith. They will literally eat enjoyable earthly food to sustain that life forevermore in peace, health and happiness. Isaiah’s prophecy of a banquet has a literal aspect to it and not wholly a spiritual aspect. The loyal and obedient peoples will literally eat dishes well-oiled, “filled with marrow,” as it were, to sustain the heart and make the face shine. They will drink wine, well aged on the dregs and filtered, to make their hearts glad.

In the prophetic psalm regarding King Solomon it is written: “He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. And he will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow. His fruit will be as in Lebanon, and those who are from the city will blossom like the vegetation of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 72:6-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Such a period of plenty marked the reign of King Solomon, but Jesus Christ, who was foreshadowed by Solomon, is greater than Solomon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 12:42</a>) Hence abundance far surpassing that of the days of King Solomon will be produced on earth under Christ’s kingdom.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>PARADISE RESTORED, MADE EARTH-WIDE</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 8.

There was no want of food in the earthly Paradise in which God placed the first man and woman in their perfect, sinless condition. Under Christ’s kingdom, which reigns on the heavenly Mount Zion, that Paradise will be restored and extended to the limits of the earth. Thus it will not be too small for <em>all</em> mankind to live in. So there was a wonderful meaning to the words of the dying Jesus Christ, when he said to the sympathetic man who was impaled on a stake beside him on that darksome day of Nisan 14, 33 C.E.: “Truly I tell you today, You will be with me in Paradise.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a>, <em>NW; Ro.</em></p>

<strong>The “Tree” Whose Fall Shocks the World</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The Republic of Lebanon has been much in the world news in recent years, but the cedars on the mountains of Lebanon have been famous for millenniums. (Note <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977363/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 9:15</a>.) No man planted those tall wide-spreading cedars there. Cedar trees were already on site before the confusion of the human language at the Tower of Babel scattered the builders in all directions from ancient Babylon on the Euphrates River, in the second century after the global flood. The Creator of heaven and earth takes the credit for planting those cedars. So <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977363/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 80:10</a> speaks of them as “the cedars of God,” and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977363/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 104:16</a> calls them “the cedars of Lebanon that he [Jehovah] planted.”</p>

<strong>The Prevailing Will of God</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“They are little inferior in size to elephants; they are bulls in their nature, color and figure. Great is their strength and great is their swiftness, neither do they spare man or beast, which they have caught sight of. . . . [They] can not be habituated to man and made tractable, not even when caught very young. The great spread of the horns <span id="page423" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="423" data-before-text="423"></span>as well as the shape and quality of them differ much from the horns of our oxen.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Little wonder the psalmist David linked the lion and the wild bull together: “Save me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of wild bulls you must answer and save me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 22:21</a>) What farmer would trust this wild bull?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>STORK AND OSTRICH CONTRASTED</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">God next asked Job if he could account for the difference between the stork and the ostrich, which are both birds and yet are so unlike in habits:</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">“Has the wing of the female ostrich flapped joyously, or has she the pinions of a stork and the plumage? For she leaves her eggs to the earth itself and in the dust she keeps them warm, and she forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them. She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers—in vain is her toil because she has no dread. For God has made her forget wisdom, and he has not given her a share in understanding. At the time she flaps her wings on high, she laughs at the horse and at its rider.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:13-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Has the wing of the ostrich flapped joyously, as that of the stork? No. The stork has powerful wings and flies very high in the air. The Bible speaks of “the stork in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 8:7</a>) But the ostrich, though it flaps its wings, cannot do the same. The stork’s pinions are of great breadth and power, the secondaries and tertiaries being as long as the primaries, giving an immense surface to the wing and enabling it to be a bird of lofty and long-continued flight. But can the ostrich flap its wings in such a joyous way?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">What a contrast, too, between the ostrich and the stork as to where they nest and lay their eggs. The female ostrich “leaves her eggs to the earth itself.” It is not said that the female ostrich in the wild necessarily forsakes her eggs. No, but she leaves her eggs to the earth itself rather than trust them to a nest built on a lofty tree, as does the stork. “As for the stork, the juniper trees are its house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:17</a>) The stork’s large and well-compacted nest is usually built in the loftiest places. Not so the ostrich. The earth is her nest. In nontropical countries the female birds incubate by day, the males taking their turn by night, carefully guarding the eggs. In tropical countries the parent birds incubate by turn during the night but leave them by day to the sun’s heat, the eggs being partly or wholly covered with sand or dust. “Actual incubation of the eggs is performed by the heat of the sun.” (<em>The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia</em>) By leaving her eggs to the earth and by keeping them warm in the dust, she appears to be doing a stupid thing: “She forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them.” She may need to leave the eggs uncared-for at the approach of enemies.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Not only is there a difference in the nest location of the ostrich and the stork but also in the way they treat their young. Says John Kitto, in <em>The Pictorial Bible,</em> about storks: “No bird is more famous for its attachment to its young; and, which is more rare among birds, for the kindness to the old and feeble of its own race.” But the ostrich? “She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers.” Wrote God’s prophet Jeremiah: “The daughter of my people becomes cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lam. 4:3</a>) Commenting on this rough treatment, English traveler Thomas Shaw wrote in <em>Travels in Barbary:</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">“A very little share of that natural affection, which so strongly exerts itself in most other creatures, is observable in the ostrich. For, upon the least distant noise, or trivial occasion, she forsakes her eggs or her young ones, to which perhaps she never returns; or, if she does, it may be too late. . . . The Arabs meet sometimes with whole nests of <span id="page424" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="424" data-before-text="424"></span>these eggs undisturbed, some of which are sweet and good, others addled and corrupted. . . . They oftener meet a few of the little ones, no bigger than well-grown pullets, half-starved, straggling and moaning about, like so many distressed orphans, for their mothers.”</p>

<strong>‘You Are More Majestic Than the Mountains’</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong>   “The high mountains are for the mountain goats,” sang the psalmist. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004202/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 104:18</a>) Mountain goats, such as the magnificently horned Nubian ibex, are among the most surefooted of all mountain dwellers. They venture along ledges that are so narrow as to appear impassable. The ibex is well-equipped to live in inaccessible places. This is partly because of the construction of its hooves. The cleft can expand under the goat’s weight, giving the animal a firm grip when it is standing or moving on narrow rock shelves. Truly, the ibex is a masterpiece of design!</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1474/0">7/15/1997, p. 24</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Acrobats of the Mountain Crags</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>“The High Mountains Are for the Mountain Goats”</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">So sang the psalmist. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997526/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 104:18</a>) Mountain goats are well equipped for living in lofty places! They are extremely agile, moving over rugged terrain with great confidence and speed. This is partly due to the construction of their hooves. The opening can expand under the goat’s weight, giving the animal a firm grip when standing or moving on narrow rock shelves.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Mountain goats also have extraordinary balance. They can leap great distances and land on a ledge scarcely large enough to accommodate all four feet. Biologist Douglas Chadwick once observed a mountain goat of another type use its balance to avoid being trapped on a ledge that was too narrow for it to turn around. He says: “After a glance at the next ledge some 400 <strong>[120 m]</strong> feet below, the goat planted its front feet and slowly walked its rear end over its head along the rock face as though it were performing a cartwheel. As I held my breath, the goat continued until its hind feet came down so that it faced the direction from which it had come.” (<em>National Geographic</em>) No wonder mountain goats have been called “the acrobats of the mountain crags”!</p>

<strong>The Wisdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">God’s care does not end with the noble lion; it extends even to the raven, though unclean by Mosaic law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 14:11-14</a>) The raven was the first creature to go forth from the ark and to stay out and trust to Jehovah God to provide for it in the earth cleansed by the global Flood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 8:6, 7</a>) Not only is the raven’s home in desolate places, but its food is scanty and must be sought over a wide extent of country, as indicated by its habit of flying restlessly about in search of food. They get their food from God. God’s own Son said: “Mark well that the ravens neither sow seed nor reap, and they have neither barn nor storehouse, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more worth are you <span id="page296" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>than birds?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 12:24</a>) Since God provides for the unclean raven, we can be certain that he will not forget or forsake those persons who put their trust in him.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">God cares for the wild animals at their season of greatest need. Their instinct comes directly from God and guides them to help themselves when giving birth. So God asks Job: “Have you come to know the appointed time for the mountain goats of the crag to give birth? Do you observe just when the hinds bring forth with birth pangs? Do you count the lunar months that they fulfill, or have you come to know the appointed time that they give birth? They bow down when they cast forth their young ones, when they get rid of their pangs. Their sons become robust, they get big in the open field; they actually go forth and do not return to them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 39:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Can any man keep an exact register of all these happenings and exercise such providential care over these creatures, the mountain goats and the hinds, as to preserve them from dangers during the time of giving birth? Wild goats and hinds are continued from age to age, but not by the care of man. If man even knew when they were going to bring forth, could he tend to them as he can for domestic animals?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Man has difficulty even getting near mountain goats, to observe them in the wild state. “The high mountains,” wrote the psalmist, “are for the mountain goats.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 104:18</a>) At one time Saul hunted for David “upon the bare rocks of the mountain goats.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Sam. 24:2</a>) The lonely cliffs above the Dead Sea in the wilderness of En-gedi must have been special haunts for wild goats. But wherever they live, man does not find it easy to get close to them, as the Swiss traveler Johanne Burckhardt wrote in his <em>Travels in Syria:</em></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">“As we approached the summit of the mountain [St. Catherine, adjacent to Mount Sinai], we saw at a distance a small flock of mountain-goats feeding among the rocks. One of our Arabs left us, and by a widely circuitous route endeavored to get to the leeward of them, and near enough to fire at them; he enjoined us to remain in sight of them, and to sit down in order not to alarm them. He had nearly reached a favorable spot behind a rock, when the goats suddenly took to flight. They could not have seen the Arab; but the wind changed, and thus they smelt him.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Just as the mountain goats get along without man, so do the hinds, the female deer. By God-given instinct, when the hind knows she is about to give birth, she secludes herself in the forest and conceals her young and cares for it. Her young ones soon “become robust” and “go forth and do not return.” They shift on their own, cared for by God.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Jehovah’s questions to Job should stir us to worship him, to trust him and to study, not only his Book of nature, but his written Word, the Book of life-giving wisdom. Then our thankfulness for his goodness will be increased: “Respond to Jehovah with thanksgiving, you people; . . . the One who is covering the heavens with clouds, the One preparing rain for the earth, the One making the mountains to sprout green grass. To the beasts he is giving their food, to the young ravens that keep calling.” “Jehovah is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 147:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 145:9</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Wisdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">God likens the rain-filled clouds to water jars of heaven, and He can tip them according to his pleasure. And when the <span id="page295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="295" data-before-text="295"></span>clouds have poured down rain in abundance, so that the dust becomes mire and the clods cleave fast together, who can seal up those water jars of heaven and prevent more rain from falling? Jehovah can hold back rain as well as produce it. The prophet Elijah prayed for God to hold back rain: “Elijah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet in prayer he prayed for it not to rain; and it did not rain upon the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land put forth its fruit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:17, 18</a>) Men who have true wisdom take up the words of Jeremiah: “Do there exist among the vain idols of the nations any that can pour down rain, or can even the heavens themselves give copious showers? Are you not the One, O Jehovah our God? And we hope in you, for you yourself have done all these things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 14:22</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">With rain and clouds there is often lightning. Can any man give life to the lightnings, so that they may fulfill his wishes? Man may wield electric forces, but the lightnings, who can send and who can control them? In God’s words to Job the lightnings are represented as reporting to God the accomplishment of their task: “Here we are!” Could Job get the lightnings to do so for him? One of the assigned tasks of lightning is to fertilize the earth electrically. “Lightning is the world’s greatest producer of nitrogen compounds,” said <em>Science Digest</em> for July, 1956. “In very dilute forms, these compounds fall to earth with rain. . . . It’s even considered possible that without lightning, virtually all plant life on earth might actually wither and die.” What wisdom in lightning! “The scientific study of lightning has been going on for more than two hundred years,” reports the volume <em>Our Astonishing Atmosphere.</em> “Though lightning has been recognized for so long as a mammoth electric flash, its cause and detailed behaviour have remained mysteries to the present time.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>HIS WISDOM IN ANIMAL CREATION</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Jehovah now takes examples of his wisdom from the animal creation, illustrating the various endowments and capabilities of living creatures. Jehovah asks: “Can you hunt prey for a lion itself and can you satisfy the lively appetite of young lions, when they crouch in the hiding places, or keep lying in the covert for an ambush? Who prepares for the raven its food when its own young ones cry to God for help, when they keep wandering about because there is nothing to eat?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:39-41</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">All the animal creation shows the matchless handiwork and loving providence of God beyond man’s understanding. Even before man was created and given dominion over the fish and fowls and beasts and creeping things, God was providing for these creatures, the lion as well as the raven. God asks Job if he would undertake to provide food for the lions. Was not this far beyond his power? The lions can shift for themselves. “The maned young lions are roaring for the prey and for seeking their food from God himself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:21</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">God’s care does not end with the noble lion; it extends even to the raven, though unclean by Mosaic law.

<strong>Creative Power—“The Maker of Heaven and Earth”</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> What do we learn from Jehovah’s use of his creative power? We are awestruck by the diversity of creation. One psalmist exclaimed: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! . . . The earth is full of what you have made.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002027/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 104:24</a>) How true! Biologists have identified well over a million species of living things on earth; yet, opinions vary as to how many millions more there may be. A human artist may find that his creativity runs dry at times. In contrast, Jehovah’s creativity​—his power to invent and create new and diverse things—​is obviously inexhaustible.</p>

<strong>“O the Depth of God’s . . . Wisdom!”</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Humans, however, are just one example of Jehovah’s creative wisdom. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002041/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 104:24</a> says: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of what you have made.” Jehovah’s wisdom is apparent in every creation around us. The ant, for example, is “instinctively wise.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002041/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:24</a>) Indeed, ant colonies are superbly organized. Some ant colonies tend, shelter, and draw nourishment from insects called aphids as if these were livestock. Other ants act as farmers, raising and cultivating “crops” of fungus. Many other creatures have been programmed to do remarkable things by instinct. A common fly performs aerobatic feats that the most advanced of man’s aircraft cannot duplicate. Migrating birds navigate by the stars, by the orientation of the earth’s magnetic field, or by some form <span id="page175" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="175" data-before-text="175"></span>of internal map. Biologists spend years studying the sophisticated behaviors that have been programmed into these creatures. How wise, then, the divine Programmer must be!</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Scientists have learned much from Jehovah’s creative wisdom. There is even a field of engineering, called biomimetics, that seeks to mimic designs found in nature. For instance, you may have gazed in wonder at the beauty of a spiderweb. But an engineer sees it as a marvel of design. Some frail-looking strands are proportionately stronger than steel, tougher than the fibers in a bulletproof vest. Just how strong? Imagine a spiderweb enlarged in scale until it is the size of a net used on a fishing boat. Such a web could catch a passenger plane in mid-flight! Yes, Jehovah has made all such things “in wisdom.”</p>

<strong>Creation</strong><br/><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb"><strong>Created Things Preceded Man’s Inventions.</strong> Thousands of years before many of man’s inventions appeared on the scene, Jehovah had provided his creations with their own versions of them. For example, the flight of birds preceded by millenniums the development of airplanes. The chambered nautilus and the cuttlefish use flotation tanks to descend and ascend in the ocean as submarines do. Octopus and squid employ jet propulsion. Bats and dolphins are experts with sonar. Several reptiles and sea birds have their own built-in “desalination plants” that enable them to drink seawater.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">By ingeniously designed nests and their use of water, termites air-condition their homes. Microscopic plants, insects, fish, and trees use their own form of “antifreeze.” Small fractions of temperature change are sensed by the built-in thermometers of some snakes, mosquitoes, mallee birds, and brush turkeys. Hornets, wasps, and yellow jackets make paper.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Thomas Edison is credited with inventing the electric light bulb, but its loss of energy through heat is a drawback. Jehovah’s creations​—sponges, fungi, bacteria, glowworms, insects, fish—​produce cold light and in many colors.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">Many migrating birds not only have compasses in their heads but they also have biological clocks. Some microscopic bacteria have rotary motors that they can run forward or in reverse.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">It is not without good reason that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001061/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Psalm 104:24</a> says: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.”</p>

<strong>“Perceived by the Things Made”</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>“NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN”</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">People look at technical accomplishments and admire human inventors. They look at the same principles employed purposefully by living creatures and say that it just happened. For the most part human inventors are really adapters. It has been done before, as Solomon said: “There is nothing new under the sun.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978523/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eccl. 1:9</a>) In the book <em>Bionics,</em> by Daniel Halacy, Jr., we read on page 19:</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">“A commercial airplane was marketed with a wing curve patterned after that of a bird. A rubber company was experimenting with a streamlining artificial ‘skin’ for boats, copied after that of marine mammals. A new ground-speed indicator for planes was patterned on the eye of a beetle, and a better TV camera simulated the mechanism of the eye of the horseshoe crab.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Men pore over the creations of Jehovah God to discover their ingenious workings and adapt them to human inventions. It reminds us of the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978523/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 12:7-9</a>: “Ask, please, the domestic animals, and they will instruct you; also the winged creatures of the heavens, and they will tell you. Or show your concern to the earth, and it will instruct you; and the fishes of the sea will declare it to you. Who among all these does not well know that the hand of Jehovah itself has done this?” Inventors appreciate receiving credit for their clever adaptations, but so often they deny recognition to the One who “in wisdom” originated everything.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978523/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24</a>.</p>

<strong>Consider What Jehovah Has Done for You</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What an abundance of good things God has provided for man’s enjoyment! To satisfy man’s hunger there is an almost endless variety of delicious fruits and vegetables and other foods. The Creator also provided abundantly for the satisfying of our emotional needs, our craving for beauty and for pleasure. He created birds and butterflies, sea and land animals, majestic mountains, hills and valleys, rivers and lakes, trees and colorful sunsets in endless variety. Think, too, about the delightful sounds of creation​—the singing of birds, the rustle of leaves in the breeze, the ocean waves washing the shore.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">And consider what God has done for you by endowing you with a marvelous body and brain! You are able to reason, to remember. You have a conscience to tell you the difference between right and wrong. You are able to conceive in your mind the existence of the Creator and to worship him though never having seen him. God also created us with an artistic sense, not only so that we can enjoy the natural beauties of the earth around us, but also so that we can take pleasure in the works of our own hands. Yes, we can delight in making and hearing beautiful music, in painting and viewing beautiful pictures.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What about life itself? To whom are we indebted for it? Do you think that you got life from your parents? You did. But where did the very first human parents get their life? From Jehovah God! Without life, we could do nothing. And for this most precious possession we owe thanks to God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974208/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To aid us in learning about him, Jehovah God has given us his Word, the Holy Bible. It tells us what his glorious qualities are and what he has done for mankind. In the Bible, God also makes known his will for his earthly creatures, his laws and principles for man’s guidance. Have you taken the time to read it?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A man of old who appreciated what Jehovah God had done for him, as well as for all mankind, was the psalmist David. After describing many of the things that God had provided for man’s enjoyment, he exclaimed: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.” That man also appreciated the value of God’s Word and how it could influence one’s life for good. Concerning it, he wrote: “The law of Jehovah is perfect, bringing back the soul. The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise. The orders from Jehovah are upright, causing the heart to rejoice . . . The judicial decisions of Jehovah are true; they have proved altogether righteous . . . in the keeping of them there is a large reward.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974208/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974208/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19:7-11</a>) Do you have a similar appreciation of all that Jehovah has done for you, and do you give expression to that appreciation?</p>

Not only are they indescribably beautiful, but they travel in their courses with such regularity that man sets his most accurate timepieces by their movements. This is what impressed astronaut John Glenn. “It is the <em>orderliness</em> of the whole universe about us,” he said, “galaxies millions of light-years across, all traveling in prescribed orbits in relation to one another.” What wisdom the Designer of this marvelous universe possesses!</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Do not his creations cause you to want to praise him? “O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is in all the earth,” the shepherd David of Bethlehem long ago was moved to sing. “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind?” These are also our sentiments. How insignificant humans are when compared with the all-wise Creator of heaven and earth!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Just look around and observe the wisdom with which God designed our earthly home. What matchless beauty there is! Can anything compare with the glorious sunsets, snowcapped mountains, sandy beaches, green valleys, rushing rivers and colorful flowers? Take a deep breath of air. It is of just the right composition of gases to sustain life. How appropriate that man absorbs oxygen from the air but returns carbon dioxide, while plants take in the carbon dioxide, utilize it in producing life-sustaining products and return oxygen to the atmosphere!</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Everywhere around us such wisdom is manifest. Observe the miracle of growth. How wonderful is the way tiny seeds bloom into glorious arrays of fragrant blossoms! Taste the marvelous variety of delicious foods. Feel the warmth of the sun. Listen to the delightful songs of birds. No wonder the appreciative psalmist sang: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made.

Therefore, accept the invitation: “O come in, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker. For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasturage and the sheep of his hand.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 95:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Although Jehovah’s infinite wisdom recommends him as a God worthy of our worship, his boundless love makes him even more desirable to us.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>ABUNDANT IN LOVE</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Jehovah God showed love by taking on the responsibility of fathering earthly children. The exceptional quality of his love was demonstrated by providing this beautiful earth as their home and settling the first human pair in a gorgeously prepared section of it. Even when Adam and Eve rebelled against him, Jehovah continued to manifest his love by permitting them to live for a time so that we and the rest of mankind could come into existence and learn of his grand provisions. It is true that allowing sinful creatures to live has resulted in much trouble on earth, and even though wicked angels and evilly inclined <span id="page230" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="230" data-before-text="230"></span>men are the ones responsible, our loving Creator has often been the one unjustly blamed.

How rich is earth’s store of minerals and oil, and how abundant that essential commodity—water!

And what a wide range of menus he prepared for man’s future enjoyment! Moreover, he created the colorful array of fish, bird and animal life, for the service and pleasure of man. Truly God’s preparation and provisioning of earth as his gift to humankind is a superlative example of his faithfulness and loving-kindness. <span id="page299" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="299" data-before-text="299"></span>What heartfelt admiration and praise it should excite among God-fearing men!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 37:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Job 12:7-10</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9, 10.

Even though fallen from perfection, the man of God can exclaim: “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.

Reflect, too, that no human production on this earth, from a tiny transistor to a mighty ocean liner, could have been constructed without the skillful manipulation of those God-given fingers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 31:10-13</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11.

No outside architect or blueprint decides the form that a growing embryo shall take. The egg cell, once made fertile, divides and multiplies of itself. By miraculous processes—designed by the all-wise Creator, and passed down through each generation of humankind—the embryo develops true to pattern, producing head, body, arms and legs. No outside building materials need be brought in to fashion those sparkling eyes, that powerful heart, or the soft hair that will provide beauty and protection. All is brought forth wondrously from the laboratory of the ever-multiplying cells. As the end of the divinely ordered process, another baby is born, with prospect of further growth to the full radiance of manhood or womanhood.

In loving obedience man could now show gratitude for all of Jehovah’s bounteous provision in the earthly paradise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-31</a>.</p>

Let no one ever slow down on his theocratic studies! Even when the early Christians were “firmly set in the truth,” Peter found it necessary to keep ‘rousing them up by way of reminding them.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:12-15</a>) Review and further study is just as important today—even more important, as the Devil is now preparing his last-ditch attack against the New World society.

They must resist the heat of old-world opposition that might dry up the tender plant of their newborn faith. In trial, and even in persecution, they must keep the vision of Jehovah’s glorious promises shining brightly before their eyes, so that they may never, never stray from the radiant path that it lights before them.

<strong>Death</strong><br/>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong><em>From the Biblical viewpoint, what is death?</em></strong></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is of interest to note the correspondency of these Biblical points with what is known scientifically of the death process. In humans, for example, when the heart stops beating, the blood ceases to circulate nourishment and oxygen (obtained by breathing) to the billions of body cells. However, <em>The World Book Encyclopedia</em> (1987, Vol. 5, p. 52b) pointed out: “A person whose heart and lungs stop working may be considered <em>clinically dead,</em> but somatic death may not yet have occurred. The individual cells of the body continue to live for several minutes. The person may be revived if the heart and lungs start working again and give the cells the oxygen they need. After about three minutes, the brain cells​—which are most sensitive to a lack of oxygen—​begin to die. The person is soon dead beyond any possibility of revival. Gradually, other cells of the body also die. The last ones to perish are the bone, hair, and skin cells, which may continue to grow for several hours.” Thus while the vital importance of breathing and of the blood in maintaining the active life-force (<em>ruʹach chai·yimʹ</em>) in the body cells is evident, at the same time it is also clear that it is not the cessation of breathing or of heartbeat alone but the disappearance of the life-force or spirit from the body cells that brings death as referred to in the Scriptures.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps 104:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 146:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Ec 8:8</a>.</p>

We read: “If you [God] take away <em>their</em> spirit, they expire, and back to their dust they go.” Yes, as this and many other texts show, both humans and animals have an impersonal life force, or spirit, that is present in every living body cell.

If God the Creator were to turn away his face from us on earth, become “dead” to us, as it were, what would become of us? The Bible psalmist had it right when he said to God: “If you conceal your face, they get disturbed. If you take away their spirit, they expire, and back to their dust they go.

<strong>The Spirit That Returns to God</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>THE SPIRIT IDENTIFIED</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">That man’s life depends on the spirit (<em>ruʹahh</em> or <em>pneuʹma</em>) is definitely stated in the Bible. We read: “If you [Jehovah] take away their spirit [<em>ruʹahh</em>], they expire, and back to their dust they go.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974066/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 104:29</a>) “The body without spirit [<em>pneuʹma</em>] is dead.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974066/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">James 2:26</a>) Hence, the spirit is that which animates the body.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But this animating force is not simply breath. Why not? Because life remains in the body cells for a brief period after breathing stops. For this reason efforts at resuscitation can succeed, also body organs can be transplanted from one person to another. But these things have to be done quickly. Once the life-force is gone from the cells of the body, efforts to prolong life are futile. All the breath in the world could not revive even as much as one cell. Viewed in this light, the “spirit” evidently is an invisible life-force, active in every living cell of man’s body.</p>

<strong>‘The Spirit Returns to God’</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Since man’s death is linked with the return of the spirit (Hebrew, <em>ruʹahh)</em> to God, manifestly man’s life depends on the spirit. This is confirmed by other passages in the Holy Scriptures. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972572/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 104:29</a> says: “If you [Jehovah] conceal your face, they get disturbed.

<strong>Death</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is of interest to note the correspondency of these Biblical points with what is known scientifically of the death process. In humans, for example, when the heart stops beating, the blood ceases to circulate the nourishment and the oxygen (obtained by breathing) to the billions of body cells. However, as is pointed out in <em>The World Book Encyclopedia</em> (1966 <span id="page431" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="431" data-before-text="431"></span>ed., Vol. 5, p. 53): “. . . all the cells of the human body do not die at once. The hair may continue to grow for several hours after death. The cells of the cortex of the brain are very susceptible to lack of oxygen. They usually die first when the blood ceases to circulate. If the cells of the brain are completely deprived of oxygen for 5 or 10 minutes they can no longer completely regain their ability to function.” Thus while the vital importance of breathing and of the blood in maintaining the life force (<em>ruʹahh; pneuʹm</em>a) in the body cells is evident, at the same time it is also clear that it is the cessation of neither breathing nor the heartbeat alone that brings death, but the disappearance of the life force or spirit from the body cells.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011108/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 104:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011108/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 146:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011108/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Eccl. 8:8</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>CAUSE OF DEATH IN HUMANS</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The first reference to death in the Scriptures occurs at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011108/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17</a> in God’s command to the first man concerning the eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, violation of which command would result in death. However, death among animals as a natural process was evidently already in effect, since they are passed over completely in the Biblical presentation of the introduction of death into the human family.

<strong>Part 1—What Do the Scriptures Say About “Survival After Death”?</strong><br/><p id="p56" data-pid="56" data-rel-pid="[104]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="44"><sup>44</sup></span> As it is described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Revelation 11:8-11</a> (<em>NW</em>): “And their corpses will be on the broad way of the great city . . . And after the three and a half days spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.” Also as it is described in Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones: “Thus saith My Lord Yahweh, unto these bones, Lo! I am about to bring into you spirit, and ye shall live; . . . And when I looked then lo! upon them were sinews, and flesh had come up, and there had spread over them skin above, but spirit was there none within them. Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the spirit, prophesy, Son of man, and thou shalt say unto the spirit, Thus saith My Lord Yahweh—From the four winds come thou, O spirit, and breathe into these [breathless] slain that they may live. And when I prophesied <span id="page538" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="538" data-before-text="538"></span>as he commanded me, then came into them the spirit and they lived and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great army.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:5-10</a>, <em>Ro;</em> also <em>Yg; Le.</em></p><p id="p105" data-pid="105" class="qu">45, 46.

Hence when the dead body returns to the earth as it was, that spirit or active force that animated that body returns to its source; it quits operating in that body. So the power to make that human creature live again rests with God, the Source of life. By the sentence of death that God pronounced upon Adam and Eve he has subjected all their offspring to condemnation and at the limit of their condemned lives he requires of them their life force, for they are condemned to death through inheriting the sin from Adam and Eve. God’s just law requires that life force or spirit of them, and thus it returns to him. When God lifts that condemnation or removes it, then he can make the relieved offspring of Adam live again by his spirit or invisible activating force. Hence the inspired Psalm says to God: “Thou hidest thy face, they are dismayed, thou withdrawest their spirit, they cease to breathe, and unto their own dust do they return: thou sendest forth thy spirit and they are created, and thou renewest the face of the ground.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ps. 104:29, 30</a>, <em>Ro;</em> also <em>Yg; Le.</em></p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" data-rel-pid="[105]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="46"><sup>46</sup></span> This life force sustained by breathing is what returned to Jairus’ daughter when Jesus took her by the hand and commanded: “Child, arise.” God heard Jesus and caused His life-imparting active force to make her body alive and breathe again and keep it from returning at that time to the dust of the earth. Jesus referred to such spirit or life force when, at his death on the stake at Calvary, he said to God: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Luke 23:46</a>, <em>NW</em>) On the third day afterward God restored that spirit or life force by resurrecting Jesus from the dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 32-36</a>) So <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> cannot be used to teach that immortal spirits of the human dead are in a spirit world enjoying greater life, knowledge and freedom than ever before and that they have all, good and bad alike, returned to God. Instead, it proves that all mankind are under condemnation of death and hence must grow old and approach death and that when they die the body will return to the dust, for God’s righteous law requires their life force of them.</p><p id="p106" data-pid="106" class="qu">47. As to life, why, according to the Bible, are humans superior to earth’s lower animals?</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" data-rel-pid="[106]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="47"><sup>47</sup></span> In this respect, mankind, because of the condemnation to death that they inherited from Adam, are like the lower animals that die, not because animals are condemned to die for sin, but because their Creator did not decree that they should live forever. Showing that thus man’s spirit is just now like that of the lower animals, the inspired wise man says: “I said in my heart concerning the speaking of the sons of men, that God might make it clear to them, and that they might see that they by themselves are but beasts. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even the same thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one kind of spirit: so that the preeminence of man above the beast is nought; for all is vanity. Every thing goeth unto one place: every thing came from the dust, and every thing returneth to the dust. Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of man that ascendeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that descendeth downward to the earth?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:18-21</a>, <em>Le;</em> also <em>Yg; Ro</em>) We see, therefore, that the spirit or invisible, activating life force that makes animals live is the same as that which <span id="page539" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="539" data-before-text="539"></span>makes mankind live, and hence the only thing that can give man any pre-eminence above a lower animal is God’s decree or God’s arrangement concerning man’s future. By God’s undeserved kindness man does enjoy such a pre-eminence over lower animals, for God has willed and provided that believing, obedient mankind may enjoy everlasting life in a righteous, death-free new world. So the enjoying of such life does not begin when the body returns to the dust at death, for the spirit that then returns to God is not an invisible, immortal counterpart of that mortal body, having all its characteristics. Such an idea of the spirit in man is simply an imaginary theory that spiritualists invent to support their teaching of “survival after death.” Their “next world” is not God’s righteous new world.</p>

<strong>Who Is God?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The word “spirit” is also used in the Bible in another sense. Addressing God in prayer, the psalmist said: “If you send forth your spirit, they are created.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002361/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 104:30</a>) This spirit is not God himself but a force that God sends forth, or uses, to accomplish whatever he wishes. By means of it, God created the physical heavens, the earth, and all living things. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002361/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 1:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002361/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Psalm 33:6</a>) His spirit is called holy spirit. God used his holy spirit to inspire the men who wrote the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002361/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:20, 21</a>) Hence, the holy spirit is the invisible active force that God uses to fulfill his purposes.</p>

<strong>Holy Spirit Active in the Invisible Heavenly Realm</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Modern-minded man may not like to acknowledge it, but mankind is dependent upon the invisible heavenly realm. If God the Creator were to turn away his face from us on earth, become “dead” to us, as it were, what would become of us? The Bible psalmist had it right when he said to God: “If you conceal your face, they get disturbed. If you take away their spirit, they expire, and back to their dust they go. If you send forth your spirit, they are created; and you make <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>the face of the ground new.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 104:29, 30</a>) Consequently the principal study for man is not man himself, but, rather, the Creator, God. As far as God is pleased to reveal to us something about the invisible heavenly realm, this fundamentally deserves study by us.</p>

<strong>Identifying the Resurrected</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> So much for the spirit-begotten Christians with a heavenly hope. What about the billions of people, including faithful men and women of God, who died without a heavenly hope prior to Christ’s first coming? And what about people today? Hundreds <span id="page241" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="241" data-before-text="241"></span>of thousands of godly men and women are living without a heavenly hope. What about the resurrection of persons of this kind who die before God destroys this old system of things and introduces his new world or system of things under the kingdom of Jesus Christ? Regarding these descendants of the first man Adam Paul’s words quoted above say: “The first man is out of the earth and made of dust . . . As the one made of dust is, so those made of dust are also.” To these the rule about kinds of seed must apply, as stated by Paul: “God gives it a body just as it has pleased him, and to each of the seeds its own body.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963282/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:37, 38</a>.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">31.

In the resurrection they will be raised with bodies belonging to the earthly seed. God will give them bodies just as it pleases him, human bodies, but not identically the same human bodies with which they died. ‘Oh! ‘ some readers may say, ‘how, then, will it be the same person?’ Almighty God will see to it that it is the same person, even without the same body.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">32. What question is raised as to the need for something to survive to preserve identity?</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"><sup>32</sup></span> At that these readers will ask: ‘Does not something have to survive death in order for the person to be the same person in the resurrection and not some newly created person like the person who died? You have proved from the Bible that the human soul dies when a human creature dies and that the corpse is either eaten up by the fish of the sea or by the worms of the earth and thus it goes out of existence. This being so, nothing survives, no soul, no body.’</p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">33.

(b) How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963282/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Psalm 104:29, 30</a> show that God can re-create human souls?</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[74]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"><sup>33</sup></span> That is Scripturally right.

How so? Because the spirit [<em>rúahh</em>] here mentioned is not the soul [<em>néfesh</em>], which has died. The spirit is the force of life that God has given or has caused to be transmitted to every person that is born. God withdraws that life force from all mankind who are under the inheritance of death from Adam, and, when God withdraws this spirit or life force, the human soul dies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963282/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) God alone can restore this spirit or life force and thus cause souls to live again. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963282/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 104:29, 30</a> says: “If you conceal your face, they get disturbed.

Instead, it proves that all mankind are under condemnation of death and hence must grow old and approach death and that when they die the body will return to the dust, for God’s righteous law requires their life force of them.</p><p id="p106" data-pid="106" class="qu">47. As to life, why, according to the Bible, are humans superior to earth’s lower animals?</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" data-rel-pid="[106]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="47"><sup>47</sup></span> In this respect, mankind, because of the condemnation to death that they inherited from Adam, are like the lower animals that die, not because animals are condemned to die for sin, but because their Creator did not decree that they should live forever. Showing that thus man’s spirit is just now like that of the lower animals, the inspired wise man says: “I said in my heart concerning the speaking of the sons of men, that God might make it clear to them, and that they might see that they by themselves are but beasts. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even the same thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one kind of spirit: so that the preeminence of man above the beast is nought; for all is vanity. Every thing goeth unto one place: every thing came from the dust, and every thing returneth to the dust. Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of man that ascendeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that descendeth downward to the earth?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955645/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:18-21</a>, <em>Le;</em> also <em>Yg; Ro</em>) We see, therefore, that the spirit or invisible, activating life force that makes animals live is the same as that which <span id="page539" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="539" data-before-text="539"></span>makes mankind live, and hence the only thing that can give man any pre-eminence above a lower animal is God’s decree or God’s arrangement concerning man’s future. By God’s undeserved kindness man does enjoy such a pre-eminence over lower animals, for God has willed and provided that believing, obedient mankind may enjoy everlasting life in a righteous, death-free new world. So the enjoying of such life does not begin when the body returns to the dust at death, for the spirit that then returns to God is not an invisible, immortal counterpart of that mortal body, having all its characteristics. Such an idea of the spirit in man is simply an imaginary theory that spiritualists invent to support their teaching of “survival after death.” Their “next world” is not God’s righteous new world.</p>

This means diligent study, first to gain accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes, and then to retain and build on that knowledge while one is advancing to Christian maturity. Let no one ever slow down on his theocratic studies! Even when the early Christians were “firmly set in the truth,” Peter found it necessary to keep ‘rousing them up by way of reminding them.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:12-15</a>) Review and further study is just as important today—even more important, as the Devil is now preparing his last-ditch attack against the New World society. Now, of all times, is the time to “pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, that we may never drift away.” To the anointed Christians Paul says: “For we actually become partakers of the Christ only if we make fast our hold on the confidence we had at the beginning firm to the end.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 3:14</a>) The same principle applies to all men of good will who seek life in the paradise earth.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6.

As Jesus promises: “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.” The sayings of Jesus are ‘spirit and life.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 4:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6:63</a>) The entire Word of God “is alive and exerts power.” “Read in it day and night,” so that you may find treasures of wisdom and discernment, and hold them fast for everlasting life. “Happy is the man that has found wisdom, and the man that gets discernment, for the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver and the produce of it even than gold. It is more precious than corals, and all other delights of yours cannot be made equal to it. Length of days is in its right hand; in its left hand there are riches and glory. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its roadways are peace. It is a tree of life to those taking hold of it, and those keeping fast hold of it are to be called happy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Josh. 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Prov. 3:13-18</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7.

As the Great Sower sows the “right seed,” “the word of God,” receptive hearts “receive the word with joy.” However, the Devil tries to prevent the seed’s taking root, or he tries to choke it off before it grows into “a tree of life.” All who are desirous of holding fast to their initial joy must cultivate the good soil of their hearts by forming regular habits of study. They must resist the heat of old-world opposition that might dry up the tender plant of their newborn faith. In trial, and even in persecution, they must keep the vision of Jehovah’s glorious promises shining brightly before their eyes, so that they may never, never stray from the radiant path that it lights before them. They must study to participate in the conquest of faith. “Everything that has been born from God conquers the world. And this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 5:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Mount, Mountain</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Figurative and Prophetic Use.</strong> Sometimes the term “mountain” applies to the soil, vegetation, and trees on the mountain’s surface.

The effects of a severe storm appear to be described when the Bible speaks of mountains ‘melting’ or ‘flowing away.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Jg 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Ps 97:5</a>) Heavy rains produce streams and raging torrents that wash the soil away, as if melting it.

<strong>The Voice of Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The 29th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 29</a> shows that the thunder of the heavens is like the voice of God. The terrible phenomena of the storm in the heavens are an expression of God’s majesty, his eternalness, his sovereignty and his unshakableness. When Jehovah speaks <span id="page754" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="754" data-before-text="754"></span>with his voice of authority from heaven, then all the nations of earth will tremble and shake and pass out of existence. Now the time has come for those of sheeplike disposition to heed the voice of God as spoken in his Word before his voice will speak from the heavens at Armageddon. Jehovah’s expressions are powerful. When he gave the Ten Commandments to Moses at Mount Sinai, it presented an awesome spectacle. He had just effected a great deliverance of his people. Probably over two million of them, men, women and children, had been brought out of Egypt now into the wilderness. He was going to lead them on to the Promised Land. They were his chosen ones; they were his theocratic organization. And he showed them his power from the heavens. “And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex. 19:16</a>, <em>AS</em>) And then, in the 18th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ex 19 verse 18</a>, we read: “And Mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.”—See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Exodus 20:18</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">16. Why do his witnesses beware when Jehovah speaks?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> The great God of heaven is not a soft-spoken individual. He is a God of indignation, a God who will express his wrath against those who do not serve him and who are fighting against him. He is not a god who can be pushed around by those whom he has created. “Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isa. 30:27</a>, <em>AS</em>) The God that Jehovah’s witnesses worship is the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and he has shown forth his magnificence and his wonderfulness as the only rightful ruler of the universe. His people are acquainted with his creation, they are acquainted with his Word, they are acquainted with his mighty acts in times past, and they have faith in what he is going to do in the near future. They can say with the psalmist, “Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honor and majesty: who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind; who maketh winds his messengers; flames of fire his ministers; who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved for ever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 104:1-5</a>, <em>AS</em>) So his witnesses beware when Jehovah speaks.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">17. What is it that those who have now come to know him want to do?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Those who have now come to know the true God of the universe and his name Jehovah are delighted to honor his name. They want to do something; they want to express to others their knowledge of Jehovah. That is why you will find Jehovah’s witnesses so active. And they say: “I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 104:33</a>, <em>AS</em>) They are anxious to join in the worship of Jehovah in holy array. They recognize that there is an organization that has been formed in the earth, Jehovah’s visible organization.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">18. What has Jehovah built up on earth, and so where is our safety?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Just as Jehovah has an invisible organization of principalities and powers, of cherubim, seraphim and angels, all in their proper station in his organization, so upon the earth Jehovah God has built up a great organization. God’s servants in the earth <span id="page755" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="755" data-before-text="755"></span>speak one language, the language that Jehovah God teaches in his Word. At the same time they are able to speak these truths from God’s Word in many tongues throughout the earth. God has not gathered his people together into one city or locality or one earthly place of safety and refuge. Through their Leader, Christ Jesus, they are sent forth to the ends of the earth, there to preach the good news of God’s kingdom. But as long as they are in his organization speaking the many tongues of the peoples, they are still sending forth the pure language of God’s Word. It is not a matter of geographic location that brings protection. It is a matter of being faithful to Jehovah God and close to him in his organization, worshiping him in holy array when Jehovah strikes at Armageddon. There must be unity among God’s people; no matter where we find them in the earth, they must see in harmony now that Jehovah has brought forth his organization Zion. Even as the children of Israel were organized in their day for marching from one place to another, and had their respective positions in the camp in the wilderness, so it is today.</p>

<strong>How Can We Be Clean in God’s Eyes?</strong><br/><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2. To be clean, what habits should we avoid?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">The Bible urges us to <strong>“cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>) Thus, we strive to avoid anything that would damage our body or our mind. Our thoughts should please Jehovah, so we do our best to reject improper thoughts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 104:34</a>) We also strive to use clean speech.​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8">What else could make us physically or morally unclean? Some substances can contaminate our body. Therefore, we avoid such things as tobacco, the chewing of betel nut or coca leaves, and the recreational use of drugs. By avoiding these, we are healthier and we show respect for the gift of life. We also strive to be morally clean by fighting against the unclean practices of masturbation and of viewing pornography. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 119:37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:5</a>) It can be difficult to overcome these habits, but Jehovah can help us to do so.​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021240/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:13</a>.</p>

Then the theme of the entire book <span id="page104" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>of Psalms is set forth with full force, as the exclamation appears for the first time: “Praise Jah, you people!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990080/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">104 Vs. 35</a>) This call to true worshipers to render Jehovah the praise due his name is, in Hebrew, just one word <em>ha·lelu–Yahʹ</em> or “Hallelujah,” which latter form is familiar to people all over the earth today. From this verse on, the expression occurs 24 times, a number of psalms both opening and closing with it.</p>
