<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204403/390/0">3/15/1968, pp. 170-172</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>True Worship Under Challenge</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Of the invasion in Hezekiah’s day, the record tells us: “And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and proceeded to seize them.” In warding off the immediate threat, Hezekiah agreed to pay tribute to Sennacherib, and he even cut off the overlaid doors and doorposts from Jehovah’s temple, in order to make this payment. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-16</a>) No doubt this was part of Hezekiah’s theocratic war strategy, a move to gain time, and to put him in a better position to grapple with the enemy. Likewise, today, there are occasions when Jehovah’s witnesses have to move cautiously in preserving their God-given right to true worship. In strongly nationalistic countries, open house-to-house or magazine witnessing is not always possible, and <span id="page171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>Jehovah’s people may have to yield this door of service to the enemy. However, by incidental witnessing, park witnessing, back-calling and studying with those known to be interested, and by other means, they continue their precious service to Jehovah, often at great personal cost.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10, 11. (a) What other wise steps did Hezekiah take, and why? (b) In the fulfillment, how have the remnant acted today?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> But Hezekiah took other wise steps looking to the preservation of Jehovah’s city and temple of worship. “When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come with his face set for war against Jerusalem, then he decided with his princes and his mighty men to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city; and so they helped him. Accordingly many people were collected together, and they went stopping up all the fountains and the torrent that floods through the middle of the land, saying: ‘Why should the kings of Assyria come and actually find a great deal of water?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:1-4</a>) Instead, these precious water supplies were tunneled into the city.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:20</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In like manner, following the reactivation of true worship in 1919, the anointed remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, representing Christ Jesus here on earth, has paid attention to the supplies of Kingdom truth, as provided by Jehovah through his Son. These refreshing waters of truth do not flow for the benefit of the willful opposers of Almighty God. They must be covered over against enemy interference. But through the building of factories, and the carrying out of printing activity throughout the earth, whether above ground or underground, the remnant has fulfilled its prophetic mission as “the faithful and discreet slave” by seeing that spiritual provision is made available “at the proper time” for all of God’s household on earth, and this despite bitter opposition in police states.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13.

Moreover, the King has equipped his followers with “the large shield of faith” and “the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,” and has revivified them for theocratic service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eph. 6:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Having this spiritual armor and an abundant supply of waters of truth, the remnant and their companion worshipers are indeed blessed, and so they may be glad, as were the sons of Korah who sang at Jehovah’s temple in Hezekiah’s day: “There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, the holiest grand tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of the city; it will not be made to totter. God will help it at the appearance of morning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 46:4, 5</a>) How true, in ancient times and also today!</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14, 15.

Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him. With him there is an arm of flesh, but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.’ And the <span id="page172" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="172" data-before-text="172"></span>people began to brace themselves upon the words of Hezekiah the king of Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:6-8</a>) What a grand assembly of encouragement that must have been! As at assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses today, so then, words of upbuilding counsel went right to the hearts of the Judeans, encouraging them to be fearless in the face of the nationalistic threats of those who can do no more than “kill the body.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 10:28</a>.</p>

<strong>Through a Dark Tunnel into the Past!</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">No, since King Hezekiah had earlier arranged for his men “to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:2-4</a>) Thus the besieging Assyrians would be hard pressed to find enough water for themselves. Then what possible water would the Jews have, with Hezekiah and the people confined “like a bird in a cage,” as Sennacherib boasted? Yes, the Jews knew that there <span id="page413" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="413" data-before-text="413"></span>was water aplenty in the cave of the Gihon spring on the eastern slope of the city. That spring was “stopped up” or hidden so the Assyrians would not know of it. Still, Gihon was outside Jerusalem’s walls. So how could it keep the Jews alive?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible tells us. It says that Hezekiah “stopped up the upper source of the waters of Gihon and kept them directed straight along down to the west to the city of David.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 20:20</a>) How did he do that? By a water tunnel cut out of solid rock. That tunnel is still there. Experts view it as “one of the great engineering feats of antiquity.” And you as a visitor can wade through it.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It seems that the spring of Gihon (sometimes now called the Virgin’s Fountain) on the lower slope of the Kidron Valley was in a cave. So the ancient Jebusite inhabitants of the city dug out some of the rock at the back and sunk a shaft down from inside the nearby wall. They could thus obtain some water by letting buckets down to the water channel. David’s men may well have sneaked into the city through this shaft. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:8</a>) Yet in Hezekiah’s time the city’s population was much larger. Hence, he undertook the cutting out of a long tunnel that would divert ample water to a pool (Siloam) on the western side of the city inside the protection of the walls. (See the small map.)</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">What an undertaking that was! One team of workers dug from the south, from the pool of Siloam. Another team came from the north, from Gihon. Think of the work involved in chipping​—with hand tools, not with pneumatic drills or modern explosives—​out of solid rock a tunnel averaging about six feet (1.8 meters) high and about two feet (.6 meters) wide. But what is more staggering is its length, 1,749 feet (533 meters). Imagine, through solid rock for almost a third of a mile!</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In that confined area only one man at a time could chip at the tunnel face. So even with ‘round the clock’ crews, it was likely six to eight months before the crews met. Though you cannot speak with any of those dedicated workers to get their impressions of the job, you can come close to that. How so?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Well, back in 1880 a lad playing near the Siloam outlet of the tunnel fell into the water. As he got up he discovered an inscription in the wall. It was carved in early Hebrew and is an invaluable example of the Hebrew writing style of the period, a style such as the prophet Isaiah himself may have used. The space cleared for the inscription was never completely filled, but in part the six lines that were written said:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">“And this was the way in which it was cut through:​—While [. . .] (were) still [. . .] axe(s), each man toward his fellow, and while there were still three cubits to be cut through, [there was heard] the voice of a man calling to his fellow, for there was <em>an overlap</em> in the rock on the right [and on the left]. And when the tunnel was driven <span id="page414" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="414" data-before-text="414"></span>through, the quarrymen hewed (the rock), each man toward his fellow, axe against axe; and the water flowed from the spring toward the reservoir for 1,200 cubits, and the height of the rock above the head(s) of the quarrymen was 100 cubits.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Just think of yourself as one of those workers chipping away deep inside the long, dark tunnel. How would you know in which direction to head? Dig to the right? To the left? Higher? Lower? And yet after many hundreds of feet the workers met​—what an accomplishment!</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Come along, as it were, and see what the tunnel is like, keeping an eye on the accompanying plan. Descending the steps to Gihon (point 1), you find the spring itself (point 2). Then you pass through part of the channel dug by the Jebusites (point 3). If you examine the walls carefully here, you will see that the upper walls and ceiling reflect better craftsmanship. Evidently Hezekiah’s workers reworked some of this section, doing a better job than the earlier Jebusites.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Soon we take a sharp left turn (point 4), where Hezekiah’s tunnel begins. You can move along quite easily. Now you do not have to crawl in a cramped passage with as little as four inches of airspace above the water, as did nineteenth-century archaeologists who explored the tunnel. The deep layer of mud silt that they had to crawl on has now been removed. So you can wade upright, though stooping low in some places. And wade you will, because the gurgling water may be up to your knees or even up to your waist, for it varies in general depth at different times during the day and during different seasons.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">As you move ahead you can tell that you are not following a straight line. No one today knows exactly why the tunnel was dug in an S shape instead of the shorter straight route, but it was. Looping around we come to point 5. Why the abrupt change in direction? Evidently at this point, when the ends were about 100 feet (30 meters) apart, the workers coming from the north first heard the sound of ax blows made by the southern crew. And those coming from the south heard the faint sound of blows when they were at point 12. You can determine this from the tunnel. Both crews began a succession of twists and corrections. Imagine the rising excitement as the men realized that they were approaching one another. Sometimes false echoes may have caused tunneling in a certain direction. But then probably a Hebrew engineer would discern the error and redirect the workers’ efforts. It seems that the crew coming northeast toward Gihon had the greater difficulty, for they made three false starts that had to be abandoned (points 11, 10, 9).</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Reconstructing the scene in your mind’s eye, you can see the worker at the tunnel face chipping away in the dim light. Hearing the chipping blows from the other tunnel, he is tense, excited and now oblivious to the smoke and poor air. Behind him the engineer may crouch, holding a torch and occasionally saying, “More to the left,” or, “In this direction, toward the sound.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Closer and closer the lead workers come. The poorer workmanship of the walls tells you of the workmen’s excitement and impatience. They abandon some of the quality displayed earlier in their tunneling.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">When you get to point 6 you are standing about where the northern crew was when someone heard “the voice of a man calling to his fellow,” as the Siloam inscription relates. Anxious cries must have been exchanged, and then the workers attacked the rock with renewed vigor. The two ends were now only three cubits apart, about four and a half feet (1.4 meters). Look at the slight zigzagging of the walls as the men raced toward one another. Even the floor gives evidence of the mounting <span id="page415" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="415" data-before-text="415"></span>tension, for from points 6 and 8 the floor begins to rise, the workers not cutting as deep.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The voices get louder and louder. Then finally, at point 7, the tip of an ax breaks through. There is a light, and a face! Yes, remarkable as it seems in view of the simple equipment available at the time, the two tunnel projects met as one life-sustaining passageway deep under the City of David. By examining the change of direction in the chipping patterns, you can determine the exact spot of the meeting. And the inscription carved about twenty feet (6 meters) from the Siloam entrance memorializes that feat (point 13). The original stone inscription is now kept in an Istanbul museum. But you can see a plaster copy of it in Jerusalem’s Israel Museum.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">For the cool water to flow from Gihon to the Pool of Siloam, the tunnelers had to make some adjustments in the tunnel floor level at the Siloam end. You can see this, for there the tunnel’s height is more than in the other sections. But once that was done, the water could flow smoothly, with a drop of about seven feet (2.1 meters) over the course of the tunnel’s length. The book <em>The City of David</em> speaks of the “perfectly graduated downward slope from the Spring Gihon to the Pool of Siloam” as “another miracle of ancient technology.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Completing your trip at Siloam, where women wash their clothes in now somewhat more brackish water, you can reflect on the history involved in what you have just experienced. Though the Bible’s mention of Hezekiah’s tunnel was recorded thousands of years ago, you today can bear witness to the historical accuracy of that record. The tunnel through which visitors to Jerusalem can wade testifies to the foresight and diligent work of Hezekiah and the Jews in Jerusalem, when faced with the Assyrian threat.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Still, even though this tunnel was dug to provide an abundance of water to withstand any long enemy siege, King Hezekiah did not rest his trust on such defense preparations. Hezekiah ultimately relied on Jehovah to protect and uphold His worshipers. Strengthened by the prophet Isaiah, King Hezekiah told the people: “Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him. With him there is an arm of flesh, but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">And that He did. While the Jews inside the city were being supplied with water that flowed from Gihon through the tunnel, the Assyrians encamped at some distance from the walls. Then in one night an angel of Jehovah struck down 185,000 Assyrians, “every valiant, mighty man and leader and chief in the camp of the king of Assyria.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:35</a>) So wading through Hezekiah’s tunnel should do more than bring to mind the history of an engineering project. It should strikingly impress on your mind and confirm in your heart that Jehovah takes an active interest in supporting those devoted to him.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="se"><strong>[Map on page 413]</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> (For fully formatted text, see publication)</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Where Temple Was Later Built</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> CITY OF DAVID</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Tyropean Valley</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Gihon</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Kidron Valley</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Siloam</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Wall</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="se"><strong>[Map on page 413]</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> (For fully formatted text, see publication)</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> <strong>HEZEKIAH’S TUNNEL</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Gihon    1  2  3  4</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong>          5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Siloam  13</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><em>What nationalistic elements in particular challenge the true worship of Jehovah’s servants, and what answer do these servants of God give?</em></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The true worship of Jehovah’s people is challenged in particular by totalitarian nationalistic forces, such as those behind the Iron Curtain and the Bamboo Curtain. The answer that Jehovah’s people give to this challenge is the same as that given by the apostles to human rulers in the first century: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” They will not compromise but will give to Jehovah that which is due him, namely, their exclusive devotion and supreme obedience.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1969167/0">a</a></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><em>What actions did king Hezekiah and his people take in the face of the Assyrian threats, having what meaning in modern times?</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As a delaying tactic King Hezekiah at first paid some tribute. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-16</a>) In like manner Jehovah’s people today, when threatened by nationalistic forces, move cautiously in preserving their God-given right to true worship. Under such conditions they do their public witnessing in inconspicuous ways and make return visits on interested persons and conduct Bible studies with them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 10:16</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To thwart the enemy invader, King Hezekiah and his people stopped up the springs outside Jerusalem and built a tunnel that brought water underground into Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 20:20</a>) Likewise the “faithful and discreet slave” has protected the flow of spiritual waters of truth. By means of worldwide publishing activity, whether aboveground or underground, it has made this spiritual provision available to God’s people despite bitter opposition.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Further, King Hezekiah went into the temple to pray and consulted the prophet Isaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:1, 2</a>) Similarly today, God’s people find strength and comfort in times of stress in association with fellow worshipers at Jehovah’s spiritual temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 10:23-25</a>) They also inquire of the “faithful and discreet slave” organization as to the right course to take.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><em>What threefold defeat did king Sennacherib experience, picturing what?</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">True to God’s promise, the Assyrian army did not invade Jerusalem, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor confront it with a shield nor cast up a siege rampart against it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:32-34</a>) Their failure to do any of these things well pictures that totalitarian forces have been unable to break into and contaminate the true worship of Jehovah God. Jehovah’s people have manifested invincible faith, standing individually and collectively impregnable against the enemy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 54:17</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">And not only did Sennacherib and his army apparently never get closer to Jerusalem than Libnah, but Jehovah by his angel in one night slew 185,000 Assyrian soldiers, breaking the back of Sennacherib’s armed might. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:35</a>) This foreshadows that Jesus Christ and his heavenly hosts will deliver all those engaging in true worship by destroying their nationalistic opposers at the battle of Armageddon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">King Sennacherib might be said to have experienced a third defeat in that he was slain by two of his sons as he was worshiping his god Nisroch. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:37</a>) Satan, “the father of the lie,” will likewise find that his self-made religion is no protection. For Christ will bind him and hurl him down into the abyss, shutting and sealing it over him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 8:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Rev. 20:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><em>What grand privilege is now to be enjoyed by Jehovah’s worshipers, and on what should they set their hearts?</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">That of telling others about the triumphs of Jehovah in times past and those yet to take place on behalf of the “great crowd.” Such may hope to survive Armageddon to enjoy endless life in an earth-wide sanctuary of praise. All who would gain everlasting life as part of either the “new heavens” or the “new earth” should set their hearts on the true worship of Jehovah, the one true God. They must sanctify his name in their hearts and lives and share in its vindication. This they do by making known Jehovah’s name and kingdom in every possible way and at every opportunity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps. 48:12-14</a>.</p>

<strong>True Worship Under Challenge</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Of the invasion in Hezekiah’s day, the record tells us: “And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and proceeded to seize them.” In warding off the immediate threat, Hezekiah agreed to pay tribute to Sennacherib, and he even cut off the overlaid doors and doorposts from Jehovah’s temple, in order to make this payment. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-16</a>) No doubt this was part of Hezekiah’s theocratic war strategy, a move to gain time, and to put him in a better position to grapple with the enemy. Likewise, today, there are occasions when Jehovah’s witnesses have to move cautiously in preserving their God-given right to true worship. In strongly nationalistic countries, open house-to-house or magazine witnessing is not always possible, and <span id="page171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>Jehovah’s people may have to yield this door of service to the enemy. However, by incidental witnessing, park witnessing, back-calling and studying with those known to be interested, and by other means, they continue their precious service to Jehovah, often at great personal cost.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10, 11. (a) What other wise steps did Hezekiah take, and why? (b) In the fulfillment, how have the remnant acted today?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> But Hezekiah took other wise steps looking to the preservation of Jehovah’s city and temple of worship. “When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come with his face set for war against Jerusalem, then he decided with his princes and his mighty men to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city; and so they helped him. Accordingly many people were collected together, and they went stopping up all the fountains and the torrent that floods through the middle of the land, saying: ‘Why should the kings of Assyria come and actually find a great deal of water?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:1-4</a>) Instead, these precious water supplies were tunneled into the city.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:20</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In like manner, following the reactivation of true worship in 1919, the anointed remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, representing Christ Jesus here on earth, has paid attention to the supplies of Kingdom truth, as provided by Jehovah through his Son. These refreshing waters of truth do not flow for the benefit of the willful opposers of Almighty God. They must be covered over against enemy interference. But through the building of factories, and the carrying out of printing activity throughout the earth, whether above ground or underground, the remnant has fulfilled its prophetic mission as “the faithful and discreet slave” by seeing that spiritual provision is made available “at the proper time” for all of God’s household on earth, and this despite bitter opposition in police states.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13.

Moreover, the King has equipped his followers with “the large shield of faith” and “the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,” and has revivified them for theocratic service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eph. 6:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Having this spiritual armor and an abundant supply of waters of truth, the remnant and their companion worshipers are indeed blessed, and so they may be glad, as were the sons of Korah who sang at Jehovah’s temple in Hezekiah’s day: “There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, the holiest grand tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of the city; it will not be made to totter. God will help it at the appearance of morning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 46:4, 5</a>) How true, in ancient times and also today!</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14, 15.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001691/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2Ch 32:2-4</a>) However, possibly with reference to another time, the record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001691/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:30</a> shows that he shut off the flow of the Gihon through its previous channel and diverted the waters to the western side of “the City of David,” well within Jerusalem’s fortifications. Evidence of the manner in which this was accomplished came to light in 1880 C.E. when an inscription was found carved in the wall of a water tunnel terminating in what is presently known as the Pool of Siloam on the W side of the old “City of David.” The inscription, in early Hebrew script regarded as dating from the eighth century B.C.E., described the excavation of the tunnel through solid rock by the two teams of men working toward each other from opposite ends. When the tunnel was completely cleared in 1910, it was found to measure some 533 m (1,749 ft), with an average height of 1.8 m (6 ft) and at times narrowing to a width of only 0.5 m (20 in.). It seems evident that this remarkable engineering feat is the result of Hezekiah’s measures to protect and maintain Jerusalem’s water supply originating in the Gihon.</p>

<strong>Hezekiah</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Building and Engineering Works.</strong> In the face of imminent attack by greedy Sennacherib, Hezekiah displayed wisdom and military strategy. He stopped up all the springs and water sources outside the city of Jerusalem so that, in the event of a siege, the Assyrians would be short on water supplies. He strengthened the city’s fortifications and “made missiles in abundance and shields.” But his trust was not in this military equipment, for in gathering together the military chieftains and the people, he encouraged them, saying: “Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him. With him there is an arm of flesh, but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2Ch 32:1-8</a>.</p>

<strong>Jerusalem</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Faithful King Hezekiah, ruling after his father, the apostate Ahaz, did cleansing and repair work in the temple area and arranged a great Passover celebration that drew worshipers to Jerusalem from all over the land, the northern kingdom included. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">2Ch 29:1-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/53/1" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/53/2" data-bid="54-3" class="b"> 30:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/53/3" data-bid="54-4" class="b"> 10-26</a>) This stimulus for true worship, however, was soon followed by attack from pagan quarters, mockers of the true God whose name rested on Jerusalem. In 732 B.C.E., eight years after Assyria’s conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel, Assyrian King Sennacherib made a scythelike sweep through Palestine, diverting some troops to threaten Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">2Ch 32:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Hezekiah had readied the city for a siege. He stopped up the water sources outside the city to hide them and make things difficult for the enemy, strengthened the walls, and fortified them.

(See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/4">ARCHAEOLOGY</a> [Palestine and Syria]; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/5">GIHON</a> No. 2.) At any rate, the city’s strength lay not in its defensive systems and supplies but in the protective power of Jehovah God, who said: “And I shall certainly defend this city to save it for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">2Ki 19:32-34</a>) The miraculous destruction of 185,000 Assyrian troops sent Sennacherib scurrying back to Assyria.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><em>What nationalistic elements in particular challenge the true worship of Jehovah’s servants, and what answer do these servants of God give?</em></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The true worship of Jehovah’s people is challenged in particular by totalitarian nationalistic forces, such as those behind the Iron Curtain and the Bamboo Curtain. The answer that Jehovah’s people give to this challenge is the same as that given by the apostles to human rulers in the first century: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” They will not compromise but will give to Jehovah that which is due him, namely, their exclusive devotion and supreme obedience.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1969167/0">a</a></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><em>What actions did king Hezekiah and his people take in the face of the Assyrian threats, having what meaning in modern times?</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As a delaying tactic King Hezekiah at first paid some tribute. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-16</a>) In like manner Jehovah’s people today, when threatened by nationalistic forces, move cautiously in preserving their God-given right to true worship. Under such conditions they do their public witnessing in inconspicuous ways and make return visits on interested persons and conduct Bible studies with them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 10:16</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To thwart the enemy invader, King Hezekiah and his people stopped up the springs outside Jerusalem and built a tunnel that brought water underground into Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 20:20</a>) Likewise the “faithful and discreet slave” has protected the flow of spiritual waters of truth. By means of worldwide publishing activity, whether aboveground or underground, it has made this spiritual provision available to God’s people despite bitter opposition.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Further, King Hezekiah went into the temple to pray and consulted the prophet Isaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:1, 2</a>) Similarly today, God’s people find strength and comfort in times of stress in association with fellow worshipers at Jehovah’s spiritual temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 10:23-25</a>) They also inquire of the “faithful and discreet slave” organization as to the right course to take.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><em>What threefold defeat did king Sennacherib experience, picturing what?</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">True to God’s promise, the Assyrian army did not invade Jerusalem, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor confront it with a shield nor cast up a siege rampart against it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:32-34</a>) Their failure to do any of these things well pictures that totalitarian forces have been unable to break into and contaminate the true worship of Jehovah God. Jehovah’s people have manifested invincible faith, standing individually and collectively impregnable against the enemy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 54:17</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">And not only did Sennacherib and his army apparently never get closer to Jerusalem than Libnah, but Jehovah by his angel in one night slew 185,000 Assyrian soldiers, breaking the back of Sennacherib’s armed might. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:35</a>) This foreshadows that Jesus Christ and his heavenly hosts will deliver all those engaging in true worship by destroying their nationalistic opposers at the battle of Armageddon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">King Sennacherib might be said to have experienced a third defeat in that he was slain by two of his sons as he was worshiping his god Nisroch.

All who would gain everlasting life as part of either the “new heavens” or the “new earth” should set their hearts on the true worship of Jehovah, the one true God. They must sanctify his name in their hearts and lives and share in its vindication. This they do by making known Jehovah’s name and kingdom in every possible way and at every opportunity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969167/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps. 48:12-14</a>.</p>

<strong>True Worship Under Challenge</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Of the invasion in Hezekiah’s day, the record tells us: “And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and proceeded to seize them.” In warding off the immediate threat, Hezekiah agreed to pay tribute to Sennacherib, and he even cut off the overlaid doors and doorposts from Jehovah’s temple, in order to make this payment. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-16</a>) No doubt this was part of Hezekiah’s theocratic war strategy, a move to gain time, and to put him in a better position to grapple with the enemy. Likewise, today, there are occasions when Jehovah’s witnesses have to move cautiously in preserving their God-given right to true worship. In strongly nationalistic countries, open house-to-house or magazine witnessing is not always possible, and <span id="page171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>Jehovah’s people may have to yield this door of service to the enemy. However, by incidental witnessing, park witnessing, back-calling and studying with those known to be interested, and by other means, they continue their precious service to Jehovah, often at great personal cost.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10, 11.

Accordingly many people were collected together, and they went stopping up all the fountains and the torrent that floods through the middle of the land, saying: ‘Why should the kings of Assyria come and actually find a great deal of water?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:1-4</a>) Instead, these precious water supplies were tunneled into the city.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:20</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In like manner, following the reactivation of true worship in 1919, the anointed remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, representing Christ Jesus here on earth, has paid attention to the supplies of Kingdom truth, as provided by Jehovah through his Son. These refreshing waters of truth do not flow for the benefit of the willful opposers of Almighty God. They must be covered over against enemy interference. But through the building of factories, and the carrying out of printing activity throughout the earth, whether above ground or underground, the remnant has fulfilled its prophetic mission as “the faithful and discreet slave” by seeing that spiritual provision is made available “at the proper time” for all of God’s household on earth, and this despite bitter opposition in police states.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13.

Moreover, the King has equipped his followers with “the large shield of faith” and “the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,” and has revivified them for theocratic service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eph. 6:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Having this spiritual armor and an abundant supply of waters of truth, the remnant and their companion worshipers are indeed blessed, and so they may be glad, as were the sons of Korah who sang at Jehovah’s temple in Hezekiah’s day: “There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, the holiest grand tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of the city; it will not be made to totter. God will help it at the appearance of morning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 46:4, 5</a>) How true, in ancient times and also today!</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14, 15.

Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him.

As at assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses today, so then, words of upbuilding counsel went right to the hearts of the Judeans, encouraging them to be fearless in the face of the nationalistic threats of those who can do no more than “kill the body.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 10:28</a>.</p>

<strong>Arms, Armor</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The smaller “shield” or “buckler” (Heb., <em>ma·ghenʹ</em>) was customarily carried by archers and is usually associated with light weapons such as the bow. For instance, it was carried by Benjaminite bowmen of Judean King Asa’s military force.

<strong>Jerusalem in Bible Times—What Does Archaeology Reveal?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Yes, in 1969, Professor Nahman Avigad discovered remains from this period. Excavations revealed a section of a massive wall, the first part being 130 feet <strong>[40 m]</strong> long, 23 feet <strong>[7 m]</strong> wide, and, according to estimates, 27 feet <strong>[8 m]</strong> high. The wall stood partly on bedrock and partly on recently built houses. Who built the wall and when? “Two passages in the Bible helped Avigad pinpoint the date and purpose of the wall,” an archaeological magazine reports. These passages read: “Furthermore, he took courage and built up all the broken-down wall and raised towers upon it, and on the outside another wall.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997442/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) “You will also pull down the houses to make the wall unattainable.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997442/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 22:10</a>) Today visitors can see part of this so-called Broad Wall in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City.</p>

<strong>True Worship Under Challenge</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Of the invasion in Hezekiah’s day, the record tells us: “And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and proceeded to seize them.” In warding off the immediate threat, Hezekiah agreed to pay tribute to Sennacherib, and he even cut off the overlaid doors and doorposts from Jehovah’s temple, in order to make this payment. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-16</a>) No doubt this was part of Hezekiah’s theocratic war strategy, a move to gain time, and to put him in a better position to grapple with the enemy. Likewise, today, there are occasions when Jehovah’s witnesses have to move cautiously in preserving their God-given right to true worship. In strongly nationalistic countries, open house-to-house or magazine witnessing is not always possible, and <span id="page171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>Jehovah’s people may have to yield this door of service to the enemy. However, by incidental witnessing, park witnessing, back-calling and studying with those known to be interested, and by other means, they continue their precious service to Jehovah, often at great personal cost.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10, 11.

Accordingly many people were collected together, and they went stopping up all the fountains and the torrent that floods through the middle of the land, saying: ‘Why should the kings of Assyria come and actually find a great deal of water?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:1-4</a>) Instead, these precious water supplies were tunneled into the city.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:20</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In like manner, following the reactivation of true worship in 1919, the anointed remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, representing Christ Jesus here on earth, has paid attention to the supplies of Kingdom truth, as provided by Jehovah through his Son. These refreshing waters of truth do not flow for the benefit of the willful opposers of Almighty God. They must be covered over against enemy interference. But through the building of factories, and the carrying out of printing activity throughout the earth, whether above ground or underground, the remnant has fulfilled its prophetic mission as “the faithful and discreet slave” by seeing that spiritual provision is made available “at the proper time” for all of God’s household on earth, and this despite bitter opposition in police states.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13.

Moreover, the King has equipped his followers with “the large shield of faith” and “the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,” and has revivified them for theocratic service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eph. 6:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Having this spiritual armor and an abundant supply of waters of truth, the remnant and their companion worshipers are indeed blessed, and so they may be glad, as were the sons of Korah who sang at Jehovah’s temple in Hezekiah’s day: “There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, the holiest grand tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of the city; it will not be made to totter. God will help it at the appearance of morning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 46:4, 5</a>) How true, in ancient times and also today!</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14, 15.

It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p>

In furtherance of this purpose, Satan has whipped up demonic propaganda, which proceeds not only from his own dragon mouth but also “out of the mouth of the wild beast [the animalistic political system of earth] and out of the mouth of the false prophet [the loudmouthed Anglo-American Empire].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13, 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 16</a>) All this croaking in support of the tottering nationalistic governments, the divided UN and other human agencies, is, in effect, the mouthing of opposition to Jehovah’s established kingdom by Christ.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">17.

And how well this is pictured by Sennacherib’s sending Tartan, Rabsaris and Rabshakeh with a heavy military force to taunt the Judeans shut up in Jerusalem! Rabshakeh, whose name appears to be a title signifying “Chief Cupbearer,” is spokesman for the group, the one entrusted with pouring out a potion of Assyrian propaganda for the Jews. He is a renegade Jew, according to Josephus, and able to speak “the Jews’ language.” And, like Rabshakeh, Satan’s cupbearers today try to get through to Jehovah’s witnesses with intimidating words that will, they hope, swerve these from their integrity to God.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">18.

Under the dictatorships, Jehovah’s witnesses <span id="page173" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="173" data-before-text="173"></span>were thrown into prison camps and killed. In democratic lands, they were set upon by howling mobs, their homes and meeting places broken into and wrecked, and their children expelled from the schools—and all as a result of nationalistic propaganda. But with all his threats, the modern-day “Rabshakeh” failed to dent the integrity of God’s witnesses. They zealously continued their service to God, with the result that the 71,509 ministers reporting service in the year before World War II broke out, in 1939, increased to 141,606 in 1945, the year the war ended.</p>

<strong>Archaeology</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Nineveh, Assyria’s capital, was the site of excavations that unearthed the immense palace of Sennacherib, containing about 70 rooms, with sculptured slabs lining over 3,000 m (nearly 10,000 ft) of the walls. One depicted Judean prisoners being led into captivity following the fall of Lachish in 732 B.C.E.

On certain prisms Sennacherib describes the Assyrian campaign against Palestine in Hezekiah’s reign (732 B.C.E.), but, notably, the boastful monarch makes no claim of having taken Jerusalem, thus confirming the Bible account. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000344/1">SENNACHERIB</a>.) The account of Sennacherib’s assassination at the hands of his sons is also recorded on an inscription of Esar-haddon, Sennacherib’s successor, and the assassination is referred to in an inscription of the following king.

Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him. With him there is an arm of flesh, but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.’ And the <span id="page172" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="172" data-before-text="172"></span>people began to brace themselves upon the words of Hezekiah the king of Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:6-8</a>) What a grand assembly of encouragement that must have been! As at assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses today, so then, words of upbuilding counsel went right to the hearts of the Judeans, encouraging them to be fearless in the face of the nationalistic threats of those who can do no more than “kill the body.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 10:28</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> As the modern-day Nazi-Fascist-Catholic Action threat increased, Jehovah continued to provide timely encouragement through his channel on earth. The <em>Watchtower</em> magazine of November 1, 1933, published most strengthening information in the article, “Fear Them Not.” And as Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and other totalitarian lands began to suffer concentration-camp imprisonment and torture, articles on Daniel’s prophecy in the October, November and December, 1934, issues of <em>The Watchtower</em> strengthened them to endure in the ‘crucible’ of persecution and to survive the “lions’ pit.” The flood of totalitarian nationalism was powerless to breach their Christian integrity, even as it is powerless to do so today, thirty years later.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>THE ISSUE DRAWN</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">16.

In furtherance of this purpose, Satan has whipped up demonic propaganda, which proceeds not only from his own dragon mouth but also “out of the mouth of the wild beast [the animalistic political system of earth] and out of the mouth of the false prophet [the loudmouthed Anglo-American Empire].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13, 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968202/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 16</a>) All this croaking in support of the tottering nationalistic governments, the divided UN and other human agencies, is, in effect, the mouthing of opposition to Jehovah’s established kingdom by Christ.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">17.

Rabshakeh, whose name appears to be a title signifying “Chief Cupbearer,” is spokesman for the group, the one entrusted with pouring out a potion of Assyrian propaganda for the Jews. He is a renegade Jew, according to Josephus, and able to speak “the Jews’ language.” And, like Rabshakeh, Satan’s cupbearers today try to get through to Jehovah’s witnesses with intimidating words that will, they hope, swerve these from their integrity to God.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">18.

<strong>Through a Dark Tunnel into the Past!</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">King Sennacherib of Assyria sent a high official entitled Rabshakeh to intimidate the Jews. Shouting out in Hebrew to the people on the walls, Rabshakeh tried to destroy the Jews’ morale and their will to resist. Considering the heat of the Middle Eastern climate, you can imagine the frightening implications of his threat that the Jews would “die by famine and <em>by thirst.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:11</a>) But was it really to be​—‘surrender or die of thirst’?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">No, since King Hezekiah had earlier arranged for his men “to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:2-4</a>) Thus the besieging Assyrians would be hard pressed to find enough water for themselves. Then what possible water would the Jews have, with Hezekiah and the people confined “like a bird in a cage,” as Sennacherib boasted? Yes, the Jews knew that there <span id="page413" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="413" data-before-text="413"></span>was water aplenty in the cave of the Gihon spring on the eastern slope of the city. That spring was “stopped up” or hidden so the Assyrians would not know of it. Still, Gihon was outside Jerusalem’s walls. So how could it keep the Jews alive?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible tells us. It says that Hezekiah “stopped up the upper source of the waters of Gihon and kept them directed straight along down to the west to the city of David.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 20:20</a>) How did he do that? By a water tunnel cut out of solid rock. That tunnel is still there. Experts view it as “one of the great engineering feats of antiquity.” And you as a visitor can wade through it.</p>

<strong>A Lost Empire That Embarrassed Bible Critics</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Of course, some details of Sennacherib’s record do not agree with the Bible. For example, archaeologist Alan Millard notes: “The most striking fact comes at the end [of Sennacherib’s record]. Hezekiah sent his messenger, and all the tribute, to Sennacherib ‘later, to Nineveh’. The Assyrian army did not carry them home in triumph in the usual way.” The Bible states that the tribute was paid before the king of Assyria returned to Nineveh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993401/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:15-17</a>) Why the difference? And why was Sennacherib unable to boast about conquering the Judean capital, Jerusalem, in the way he boasted of his conquest of the Judean fortress Lachish? Three Bible writers give the answer. One of them, an eyewitness, wrote: “The angel of Jehovah proceeded to go forth and strike down a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When people rose up early in the morning, why, there all of them were dead carcasses. Hence Sennacherib the king of Assyria pulled away and went and returned and took up dwelling in Nineveh.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993401/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 37:36, 37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993401/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 19:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993401/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In his book <em>Treasures From Bible Times,</em> Millard concludes: “There is no good reason to doubt this report . . . Understandably, Sennacherib would not record such a disaster for his successors to read, for it would discredit him.” Instead, Sennacherib tried to create the impression that his Judean invasion had been a success and that Hezekiah continued in submission, sending the tribute to Nineveh.</p>

With the break of dawn, an eerie stillness hovers over the camp. Nothing stirs. At last, some Judeans venture out from Libnah to investigate. Come all of you, and look! What a sight! For it happened “on that night that the angel of Jehovah proceeded to go out and strike down a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians.

Jehovah’s archangel and Executioner, Christ Jesus, will come swiftly, quietly, thieflike. There will be no escape for Gog’s mob. Their last taunting challenge against the assembled remnant of Jehovah’s anointed people will be turned back as God’s King proceeds to smash them with a rod of iron, and to mash them in the winepress of the wrath of Almighty God.

God’s righteous judgment decrees more than this. It is recorded concerning Sennacherib in God’s Word (and confirmed in the recently discovered prism of Esarhaddon<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1968203/1">b</a>) that “later on he entered the house of his god and there certain ones that had come out of his own inward parts felled him with the sword. Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and out of the hand of all others and gave them rest all around.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968203/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:21, 22</a>) Satan, “the father of the lie,” will likewise find that his self-made religion is no protection. For Christ will surely bind him and hurl him down into the lifeless abyss, shutting and sealing it over him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968203/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 20:2, 3</a>) Only then will God’s true worshipers have “rest all around.”</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">24.

All the earth will come to enjoy the sabbath rest of Christ’s 1,000-year Kingdom reign, and—marvelous prospect!—the Redeemer Christ will be exalted also in the yes of many from the nations of mankind who will be brought back from gravedom by a resurrection.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968203/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">25.

<strong>Sennacherib</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Son of Sargon II and king of Assyria. He inherited from his father an empire of great strength, but was obliged to spend most of his <span id="page1469" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1469" data-before-text="1469"></span>reign in subduing revolts, particularly as regards the city of Babylon.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Sennacherib appears to have been serving as a governor or general in the northern region of Assyria during his father’s reign. After his succession to the throne, this region evidently caused him little trouble, his difficulties coming chiefly from the S and the W. The Chaldean Merodach-baladan (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 39:1</a>), abandoning his refuge in Elam into which Sennacherib’s father Sargon had driven him, now proclaimed himself king of Babylon. Sennacherib marched against him and his Elamite allies, defeating them at Kish. Merodach-baladan, however, escaped, going into hiding for another three years. Sennacherib entered Babylon and set Bel-ibni on the throne as viceroy. Other punitive expeditions were thereafter effected to keep in check the peoples in the hill countries surrounding Assyria.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Then, in what Sennacherib refers to as his “third campaign,” he moved against “Hatti,” a term evidently referring at that time to Phoenicia and Palestine. This area was in a state of general rebellion against the Assyrian yoke. Among those who had rejected such domination was King Hezekiah of Judah (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:7</a>), though there is no evidence to show that he was in coalition with the other kingdoms in revolt.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In Hezekiah’s fourteenth year (732 B.C.E.) Sennacherib’s forces swept westward, capturing Sidon, Achzib, Acco and other cities on the Phoenician coast and then headed south. Frightened kingdoms, including those of Moab, Edom and Ashdod, are listed as now sending out tribute to express submission. Recalcitrant Ashkelon was taken by force along with the nearby towns of Joppa and Beth-dagon. An Assyrian inscription accuses the people and nobles of the Philistine city of Ekron of having handed their king Padi over to Hezekiah, who, according to Sennacherib, “held him in prison, unlawfully.” (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:8</a>.) The inhabitants of Ekron are described as having petitioned Egypt and Ethiopia for help to stave off or thwart the Assyrian attack.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible record indicates that at about this point Sennacherib attacked Judah, laying siege to and capturing many of its fortified cities and towns. Hezekiah now sent word to the Assyrian at Lachish offering to pay the sum of tribute Sennacherib might impose. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13, 14</a>) Sennacherib’s capture of Lachish is presented in a frieze showing him seated on a throne before the vanquished city, accepting the spoils of that city brought to him while some of the captives are being tortured.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible account does not indicate whether King Padi, if in reality a captive of Hezekiah, was now released, but it does show that Hezekiah paid the tribute demanded by Sennacherib of three hundred silver talents (over $425,000) and thirty gold talents (some $1,150,000). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:14-16</a>) Now, however, Sennacherib sent a committee of three officers to call upon the king and people of Jerusalem to make a capitulation to him and, eventually, submit to being sent off into exile. The Assyrian message was particularly disdainful of Hezekiah’s reliance on Jehovah. Through his spokesman, Sennacherib boasted that Jehovah would prove to be as impotent as were the gods of the lands that had already fallen before the Assyrian might.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:17-35</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Assyrian committee returned to Sennacherib, who was now fighting against Libnah, as it was being heard “respecting Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia: ‘Here he has come out to fight against you.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:8, 9</a>) Sennacherib’s inscriptions speak of a battle at Eltekeh (a few miles N of Libnah) in which he claims to have defeated an Egyptian army and the forces of “the king of Ethiopia.” He then describes his conquest of Ekron and his restoration of the freed Padi to the throne there.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH DESTROYS THE ELITE OF HIS ARMY</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">As for Jerusalem, though Sennacherib had sent threatening letters warning Hezekiah that he had not desisted from his determination to take the Judean capital (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 37:9-20</a>), the record shows that the Assyrians did not so much as “shoot an arrow there, . . . nor cast up a siege rampart against it.” Jehovah, whom Sennacherib had taunted, sent out an angel who, in one night, struck down “a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians,” sending Sennacherib back “with shame of face to his own land.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 37:33-37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Sennacherib’s inscriptions make no mention of the disaster suffered by his forces. But, as Professor Jack Finegan comments in his book <em>Light from the Ancient Past</em> (1946 ed., p. 178): “In view of the general note of boasting which pervades the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings, . . . it is hardly to be expected that Sennacherib would record such a defeat.” It is interesting, nevertheless, to note the version that Sennacherib presents of the matter, as found inscribed on what is known as the Oriental Institute Prism preserved at the University of Chicago. In part he says: “As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities, walled forts and to the countless small villages in their vicinity, and conquered [them] by means of well-stamped [earth-] ramps, and battering-rams brought [thus] near [to the walls] [combined with] the attack by foot soldiers, [using] mines, breeches as well as sapper work. I drove out [of them] 200,150 people, young and old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, big and small cattle beyond counting, and considered [them] booty. Himself [Hezekiah] I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage. . . . His towns which I had plundered, I took away from his country and gave them [over] to Mitinti, king of Ashdod, Padi, king of Ekron, end Sillibel, king of Gaza. . . . Hezekiah himself, . . . did send me, later, to Nineveh, my lordly city, together with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, precious stones, antimony, large cuts of red stone, couches [inlaid] with ivory, <em>nimedu-</em>chairs [inlaid] with ivory, elephant-hides, ebony-wood, box-wood [and] all kinds of valuable treasures, his [own] daughters, concubines, male and female musicians. In order to deliver his tribute and to do obeisance as a slave he sent his [personal] messenger.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">This boastful version inflates the number of silver talents sent from three hundred to eight hundred, and doubtless does so with other details of the tribute paid; but in other regards it remarkably confirms the Bible record and shows that Sennacherib made no claims of capturing Jerusalem. It should be noted, however, that Sennacherib presents the matter of Hezekiah’s paying tribute as having come <em>after</em> the Assyrian’s threat of a siege against Jerusalem, whereas the Bible account shows it was paid <em>before.</em> As to the likely reason for this inversion of matters, note the observation made in <em>Funk and Wagnalls New Standard Bible Dictionary</em> (p. 829): “The close of this campaign of S[ennacherib] is veiled in obscurity. What he did after the capture of Ekron . . . is still a mystery. In his annals, S[ennacherib] locates at this point his punishment of Hezekiah, his raiding of the country of Judah, and his disposition of the territory and cities of Judah. This order of events looks like a screen to cover up something which he does not wish to mention.” The Bible record shows that Sennacherib hurried back to Nineveh after the divinely wrought disaster to his troops, and so Sennacherib’s inverted account conveniently has Hezekiah’s tribute being paid to him through a special messenger <em>at Nineveh.</em> It is certainly significant that ancient inscriptions and records show no further campaign by Sennacherib to Palestine, although historians claim that his reign continued for another twenty years.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Jewish historian of the first century C.E., Josephus, claims to quote the Babylonian Berossus (considered as of the third century B.C.E.) as recording the event thus: “Now when Sennacherib was returning from his Egyptian war to Jerusalem, he found his army under Rabshakeh his general in danger, <span id="page1470" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1470" data-before-text="1470"></span>for God had sent a pestilential distemper upon his army; and on the very first night of the siege, a hundred fourscore and five thousand, with their captains and generals, were destroyed.” Some commentators attempt to explain the disaster by an account from Herodotus (of the fifth century B.C.E.) in which he claims that a legion of rats gnawed everything in the Assyrians’ weapons that was made of rope or leather, leaving them unable to carry out an invasion of Egypt. This account obviously does not coincide with the Biblical record, nor does Herodotus’ description of the Assyrian campaign harmonize with the Assyrian inscriptions. Nevertheless, the accounts by Berossus and Herodotus at least reflect the fact that Sennacherib’s forces met up with sudden and calamitous difficulty in this campaign.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Sennacherib’s troubles had not ended, however, and following his return to Assyria he had to quell another revolt in Babylon, provoked by Merodach-baladan. This time Sennacherib placed his own son, Ashur-nadin-shumi, as king in Babylon. Six years later Sennacherib embarked on a campaign against the Elamites, but they soon retaliated by invading Mesopotamia, captured Ashur-nadin-shumi, and placed their own king on the throne of Babylon. Several years of struggle for control of the region followed, until finally the enraged Sennacherib took vengeance on Babylon by leveling it to the ground, an unparalleled act in view of Babylon’s position as the “Holy City” of all Mesopotamia. The remaining years of Sennacherib’s reign were apparently without major incident.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Sennacherib’s death is considered to have come some twenty years after his campaign against Jerusalem. This figure is dependent on Assyrian records, their reliability being subject to question. At any rate, it should be noted that the Bible account does not state that Sennacherib’s death occurred immediately upon his return to Nineveh. “Later on he entered the house of his god” Nisroch, and his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, “struck him down with the sword,” escaping to the land of Ararat. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:37, 38</a>) An inscription of his son and successor, Esar-haddon, confirms this.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BUILDING WORKS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The Assyrian Empire thus saw no particular expansion under Sennacherib. He did, however, carry out an ambitious building project in Nineveh, which he had restored to its position as the capital city. The vast palace he erected there was a complex of halls, courts and rooms of state covering an area 1,500 feet (457 meters) long by 700 feet (213 meters) wide. He brought in water from thirty miles (48 kilometers) away, constructing a causeway over the Gomer River, known as the Jerwan Aqueduct. Its waters contributed toward the irrigation of gardens and parks, as well as the strengthening of the city’s defenses by its encircling moat.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

For it happened “on that night that the angel of Jehovah proceeded to go out and strike down a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians.

<strong>Barak—Judge and Deliverer of Israel</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">There is more to this inspired account; it is also of prophetic import. How can we be certain of this? Because the discomfiture and defeat of Sisera and his forces took place on the plains of Megiddo, the first of the battles to make that place famous and which battles have served as symbols of the battle of the great day of God the Almighty, Armageddon.

<strong>Haughtiness</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At one time good King Hezekiah became, for a brief period, haughty in heart, and his haughtiness evidently infected the people he ruled. He had been exalted in rulership because of Jehovah’s blessing, but he failed to appreciate and to recognize that all credit should have gone to God. The chronicler writes of him: “But according to the benefit rendered him Hezekiah made no return, for his heart became haughty and there came to be indignation against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.” Happily, he recovered from this dangerous attitude. The account continues: “However, Hezekiah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and Jehovah’s indignation did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001919/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Ch 32:25, 26</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001919/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa 3:16-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001919/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eze 28:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001919/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001919/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

<strong>Hezekiah</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>Hezekiah’s Mistake and Repentance.</strong> The Scripture record states that “according to the benefit rendered him Hezekiah made no return, for his heart became haughty and there came to be indignation against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2Ch 32:25</a>) The Bible does not say whether or not this haughtiness was connected with his unwise act in showing the entire treasure of his house and all his dominion to the messengers of the Babylonian king Berodach-baladan (Merodach-baladan) who were sent to Hezekiah after he recovered from his illness. Hezekiah may have displayed all this wealth to impress the king of Babylon as a possible ally against the king of Assyria. This, of course, could tend to excite the greed of the Babylonians. The prophet Isaiah was against any alliance with or dependence on God’s age-old enemy Babylon. When Isaiah heard how Hezekiah had treated the Babylonian messengers, he uttered the inspired prophecy from Jehovah that the Babylonians in time would carry away everything to Babylon, including some of Hezekiah’s descendants. Hezekiah, however, humbled himself and God kindly allowed that the calamity would not come in his days.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2Ki 20:12-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2Ch 32:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> Isa 39:1-8</a>.</p>

<strong>Will You Apply Your Heart to the Things Written?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> The Bible does not tell us just what caused Hezekiah’s heart to become haughty. Might it have been his victory against the Assyrians or his being cured by God miraculously? Could it have been because of his “vast riches and glory”? In any case, because Hezekiah was haughty, he “did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him.” How sad! Though he could plead with God that he had served Him with a complete heart, Hezekiah did for a time displease Jehovah. Later, though, “Hezekiah humbled himself,” so he and his people were spared God’s indignation.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:25-27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ps. 138:6</a>.</p>

Yes, humility is the opposite of haughtiness. Therefore, in the next article, we will consider how we can cultivate and maintain Christian humility.</p>

<strong>Take Care Not to Belittle the Name of Jehovah!</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Merodach-baladan had sent messengers with letters and a gift to Hezekiah, who was pleased to receive them. Perhaps to impress the king of Babylon as a possible ally against the king of Assyria, Hezekiah showed the Babylonian messengers his properties and wealth. Upon hearing how Hezekiah had treated the messengers, Isaiah said: “Hear the word of Jehovah of armies, ‘Look! Days are coming, and all that is in your own house and that your forefathers have stored up down to this day will actually be carried to Babylon.’ ‘Nothing will be left,’ Jehovah has said. ‘And some of your own sons that will come forth from you, to whom you will become <span id="page570" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="570" data-before-text="570"></span>father, will themselves be taken and actually become court officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964686/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 39:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">It may have been with regard to his dealings with the Babylonian messengers of Merodach-baladan that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964686/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:24-26</a> refers, saying: “In those days Hezekiah fell sick to the point of dying, and he began to pray to Jehovah. So He talked to him and a portent He gave him. But according to the benefit rendered him Hezekiah made no return, for his heart became haughty and there came to be indignation against him and against Judah and Jerusalem. However, Hezekiah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and Jehovah’s indignation did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The relations of King Sennacherib of Assyria with King Merodach-baladan of Babylon are described in the book <em>Israel and Babylon,</em> page 33:</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="si">Sennacherib’s first task was to conquer that “prop of evil deeds,” “that worker of wickedness,” as he quaintly describes him. Babylon was captured but Merodach-baladan escaped and fled. It was at this period, rather than at the time of his earlier conflict with Sargon, that Merodach-baladan sought to enlist help from Hezekiah of Judah as recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964686/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:12-19</a>. Babylon, however, continued to give trouble with the readily granted aid of the Elamites, Merodach-baladan making yet another appearance, if not more than one, on the scene; she was finally crushed in 689, the city being levelled to the ground. Apparently Sennacherib had treated Babylon with great forbearance up to this time, and adopted this terrible policy in sheer despair. [Sidney] Smith thinks [in his book <em>The First Campaign of Sennacherib</em>] that a passage in the annals of Ashurbanipal may be interpreted to mean that Sennacherib was actually engaged in the reconstruction of Babylon when he was assassinated.—1925 edition, by W. L. Wardle, M.A., B.D., London, England.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Esar-haddon succeeded his assassinated father to the throne of Nineveh, capital of Assyria.

Ashurbanipal succeeded him, appointing a viceroy to rule Babylon. Nabopolassar the father of Nebuchadnezzar II was the last viceroy appointed by Assyria.—<em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopædia,</em> edition of 1955.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Assyria had already suffered a most humiliating defeat at the hand of Jehovah for belittling his name. Would Assyria, “the land of Nimrod,” be able to hold her position as Second World Power in the face of Jehovah’s prophecy that he would bring execution upon her for despising his name and for her bitter enmity against God’s people? She had been able to bring about the fall and destruction of Babylon, but she had not been able to capture Zion, “the town of the grand King.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964686/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mic. 5:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964686/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Ps. 48:1, 2</a>) How Assyria would have her judgment and how Jerusalem under the rule of the kings of David’s line would have a clash with Babylon will be discussed in the next issue of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>

While Sennacherib was with his army besieging the strongly fortified city of Lachish, he sent a part of his army along with a deputation of military chiefs to demand capitulation of Jerusalem. The spokesman for the group was Rabshakeh (not the man’s name, but his military title), who spoke Hebrew fluently. He loudly ridiculed Hezekiah and taunted Jehovah, boasting that Jehovah could no more deliver Jerusalem than the gods of the other nations had been able to save the lands of their worshipers from the king of Assyria.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 32:9-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/22/2" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Isa. 36:2-20</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Hezekiah was greatly distressed, but continued to trust in Jehovah and appealed to Him at the temple, also sending some of the head ones of the people to the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah’s reply, from Jehovah, was that Sennacherib would hear a report and would return to his own land, where he would be slain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:1-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:1-7</a>) At this time Sennacherib had pulled away from Lachish to Libnah, where he heard that Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia had come out to fight against him. Nevertheless, Sennacherib sent letters by messenger to Hezekiah, continuing his threats and taunting Jehovah the God of Israel. On receipt of the highly reproachful letters, Hezekiah spread them before Jehovah, who again answered through Isaiah, taunting Sennacherib in return and assuring that the Assyrians would not enter Jerusalem, for Jehovah himself would “certainly defend this city to save it for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:8-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:8-35</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">During the night Jehovah sent his angel, who destroyed 185,000 of the cream of Sennacherib’s troops, “every valiant, mighty man and leader and chief in the camp of the king of Assyria, so that he went back with shame of face to his own land.”—Later “it came about that as he was bowing down at the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his own sons, struck him down with the sword.” Thus Sennacherib’s threat to Jerusalem was effectually removed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:36-38</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">An inscription on a prism has been discovered describing Sennacherib’s defeat of the Ethiopian forces; it also says: “As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities, . . . and conquered (them) . . . Himself I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage.” He does not claim to have captured the city. This supports the Bible account of Hezekiah’s revolt against Assyria and Sennacherib’s failure to take Jerusalem. In the custom of the inscriptions of the pagan kings, to exalt themselves, Sennacherib in this inscription exaggerates the amount of silver paid by Hezekiah, as 800 talents, in contrast with the Bible’s 300.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>MIRACULOUS EXTENSION OF HEZEKIAH’S LIFE</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Around the time of Sennacherib’s threats against Jerusalem Hezekiah was struck down with a malignant boil. He was instructed by the prophet Isaiah to arrange his affairs in preparation for death. At this time Hezekiah had not yet had a son, and it therefore appeared that the royal Davidic line was in danger of being broken. Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah fervently, with tears, whereupon Jehovah sent Isaiah back to inform Hezekiah that he would have fifteen years added to his life. A miraculous sign was given, the shadow of the sun being caused to move ten steps backward on “the stairs of Ahaz.” (See SUNDIAL). In the third year afterward Hezekiah had a son called Manasseh, who later succeeded him on the throne.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:1-11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 21:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/26/3" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> Isa. 38:1-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/26/4" data-bid="27-5" class="b"> 21</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>HEZEKIAH’S MISTAKE AND REPENTANCE</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The Scripture record states that “according to the benefit rendered him Hezekiah made no return, for his heart became haughty and there came to be indignation against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:25</a>) The Bible does not say whether or not this haughtiness was connected with his unwise act in showing the entire treasure of his house and all his dominion to the messengers of the Babylonian king Berodach-baladan (Merodach-baladan) who were sent to Hezekiah after he recovered from his illness. Hezekiah may have displayed all this wealth to impress the king of Babylon as a possible ally against the king of Assyria. This, of course, could tend to excite the greed of the Babylonians. The prophet Isaiah was against any alliance with or dependence on God’s age-old enemy Babylon. When Isaiah heard how Hezekiah had treated the Babylonian messengers, he uttered the inspired prophecy from Jehovah that the Babylonians in time would carry away everything to Babylon, including some of Hezekiah’s descendants. Hezekiah, however, humbled himself and God kindly allowed that the calamity would not come in his days.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:12-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 32:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> Isa. 39:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Hezekiah was favorably spoken of in the days of the prophet Jeremiah by some of the heads of the people in Jerusalem, because of his humble quality of giving attention to Micah of Moresheth, the prophet of Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Jer. 26:17-19</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">2.

<strong>Archaeology</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">In Jerusalem in 1867 an old water tunnel was discovered, running from the fountain of Gihon back into the hill behind. (See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000344/5">GIHON</a> No. 2.) This may illustrate the account of David’s capture of the city at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000344/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Samuel 5:6-10</a>. In 1909-1911 the entire system of tunnels connected with the Gihon spring was cleared. One tunnel, known as the Siloam Tunnel, averaged 1.8 m (6 ft) in height and was cut through rock for a distance of some 533 m (1,749 ft) from Gihon to the Pool of Siloam in the Tyropoeon Valley (within the city). It thus seems to be the project of King Hezekiah described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000344/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:20</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000344/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>. Of great interest was the ancient inscription found on the tunnel wall in early Hebrew monumental script describing the cutting of the tunnel and its length. This inscription is used for comparison in dating other Hebrew inscriptions found.</p>

<strong>Gihon</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When Assyrian attack became imminent in Hezekiah’s reign (732 B.C.E.), King Hezekiah took <span id="page942" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="942" data-before-text="942"></span>measures to ensure that Jerusalem’s supply of water would not fall into the hands of the enemy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001691/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2Ch 32:2-4</a>) However, possibly with reference to another time, the record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001691/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:30</a> shows that he shut off the flow of the Gihon through its previous channel and diverted the waters to the western side of “the City of David,” well within Jerusalem’s fortifications. Evidence of the manner in which this was accomplished came to light in 1880 C.E. when an inscription was found carved in the wall of a water tunnel terminating in what is presently known as the Pool of Siloam on the W side of the old “City of David.” The inscription, in early Hebrew script regarded as dating from the eighth century B.C.E., described the excavation of the tunnel through solid rock by the two teams of men working toward each other from opposite ends. When the tunnel was completely cleared in 1910, it was found to measure some 533 m (1,749 ft), with an average height of 1.8 m (6 ft) and at times narrowing to a width of only 0.5 m (20 in.). It seems evident that this remarkable engineering feat is the result of Hezekiah’s measures to protect and maintain Jerusalem’s water supply originating in the Gihon.</p>

<strong>Hezekiah</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">One of the outstanding engineering feats of ancient times was the aqueduct of Hezekiah. It ran from the well of Gihon, E of the northern part of the City of David, in a rather irregular course, extending some 533 m (1,749 ft) to the Pool of Siloam in the Tyropoeon Valley below the City of David but within a new wall added to the southern part of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2Ki 20:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 2Ch 32:30</a>) An inscription in ancient Hebrew characters was found by archaeologists on the wall of the narrow tunnel, which had an average height of 1.8 m (6 ft). The inscription reads, in part: “And this was the way in which it was cut through:​—While [. . .] (were) still [. . .] axe(s), each man toward his fellow, and while there were still three cubits to be cut through, [there was heard] the voice of a man calling to his fellow, for there was <em>an overlap</em> in the rock on the right [and on the left]. And when the tunnel was driven through, the quarrymen hewed (the rock), each man toward his fellow, axe against axe; and the water flowed from the spring toward the reservoir for 1,200 cubits, and the height of the rock above the head(s) of the quarrymen was 100 cubits.” (<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> edited by J. B. Pritchard, 1974, p. 321) So the tunnel was cut through the rock from both ends, meeting in the middle​—a real engineering accomplishment.</p>

<strong>Jerusalem</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Faithful King Hezekiah, ruling after his father, the apostate Ahaz, did cleansing and repair work in the temple area and arranged a great Passover celebration that drew worshipers to Jerusalem from all over the land, the northern kingdom included.

In 732 B.C.E., eight years after Assyria’s conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel, Assyrian King Sennacherib made a scythelike sweep through Palestine, diverting some troops to threaten Jerusalem.

<strong>Jerusalem in Bible Times—What Does Archaeology Reveal?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Other questions have been raised about the famous Siloam Tunnel, likely dug by King Hezekiah’s engineers in the eighth century B.C.E. and referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997442/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:20</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997442/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>. How <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>could the two teams of tunnelers, digging from opposite ends, manage to meet? Why did they choose a serpentine path, making the tunnel considerably longer than a straight one? How did they get enough air to breathe, especially since they would likely have used oil-burning lamps?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The magazine <em>Biblical Archaeology Review</em> has offered possible answers to such questions. Dan Gill, a geological consultant of the excavation, is quoted as saying: “Underlying the City of David is a well-developed natural karst system. <em>Karst</em> is a geological term that describes an irregular region of sinks, caverns and channels caused by groundwater as it seeps and flows through underground rock formations. . . . Our geological examination of the subterranean waterworks beneath the City of David indicates that they were fashioned essentially by skillful human enlargement of natural (karstic) dissolution channels and shafts that were integrated into functional water supply systems.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This may help to explain how the Siloam Tunnel was excavated. It could have followed the winding course of a natural channel under the hill. Teams working from each end could have dug a provisional tunnel by altering existing caverns. Then a sloping channel was dug for the water to flow from the Gihon spring to the Pool of Siloam, which probably was located inside the city walls. This was a real engineering feat as the height difference between the two ends is only 12.5 inches <strong>[32 cm]</strong>, despite its length of 1,749 feet <strong>[533 m]</strong>.</p>

<strong>Practical Lessons From the Promised Land</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Jerusalem drew a supply of water from the Pool of Siloam. However, during the eighth century B.C.E., in anticipation of a siege by the Assyrians, King Hezekiah built an outer wall to protect the Pool of Siloam, enclosing it within the city. He also stopped up the springs outside the city, so that the <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>besieging Assyrians would be hard-pressed to find water for themselves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:2-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996601/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isaiah 22:11</a>) That is not all. Hezekiah found a way to divert an extra supply of water right into Jerusalem!</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In what has been called one of the great engineering feats of antiquity, Hezekiah dug a tunnel from the spring of Gihon all the way to the Pool of Siloam.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1996601/1">b</a> Averaging 6 feet <strong>[1.8 m]</strong> in height, this tunnel was 1,749 feet <strong>[533 m]</strong> long. Just imagine it—a tunnel almost a third of a mile <strong>[half a kilometer]</strong> long, cut through rock! Today, some 2,700 years later, visitors to Jerusalem can wade through this masterpiece of engineering, commonly known as Hezekiah’s tunnel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 32:30</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Hezekiah’s efforts to protect and increase Jerusalem’s water supply can teach us a practical lesson. Jehovah is “the source of living water.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jeremiah 2:13</a>) His thoughts, contained in the Bible, are life-sustaining. That is why personal Bible study is essential. But opportunity for study, and the resulting knowledge, will not simply flow to you. You may have to ‘dig tunnels,’ such as through your hard-packed daily routine, to make room for it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996601/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:15, 16</a>) Once you have begun, stick to your schedule, giving high priority to your personal study.

On each side and above are rough stone walls. Water is flowing up to your knees, so you must move carefully. Does this sound frightening​—or fascinating?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You would have every reason to be fascinated by a trip through this dark tunnel in Jerusalem, under the ancient City of David. Why so? Because in wading through this stream you would be wading in a part of history that remarkably confirms the Bible record.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The long rock tunnel is commonly called Hezekiah’s Tunnel or the Siloam Tunnel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:20</a>) For your trip through it you probably would find sneakers and shorts to be practical dress. With flashlight in hand you could in less than an hour confirm an account written in the Bible nearly three thousand years ago. But before doing so, whether in the actual flowing water or here on the printed page, briefly consider this impressive tunnel’s past.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When Hezekiah became king of Judah back in 745 B.C.E. the powerful nation of Assyria was oppressing the people of Israel and Judah. By 740 B.C.E. the Assyrian hordes had conquered and desolated the northern kingdom of Israel and then began invading Judah. One after another the fortified cities fell to the brutal Assyrians. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:9-11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Then came Jerusalem’s turn. How could the city survive the invincible armies of the second world power of Bible history?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">King Sennacherib of Assyria sent a high official entitled Rabshakeh to intimidate the Jews. Shouting out in Hebrew to the people on the walls, Rabshakeh tried to destroy the Jews’ morale and their will to resist. Considering the heat of the Middle Eastern climate, you can imagine the frightening implications of his threat that the Jews would “die by famine and <em>by thirst.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:11</a>) But was it really to be​—‘surrender or die of thirst’?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">No, since King Hezekiah had earlier arranged for his men “to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:2-4</a>) Thus the besieging Assyrians would be hard pressed to find enough water for themselves. Then what possible water would the Jews have, with Hezekiah and the people confined “like a bird in a cage,” as Sennacherib boasted? Yes, the Jews knew that there <span id="page413" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="413" data-before-text="413"></span>was water aplenty in the cave of the Gihon spring on the eastern slope of the city. That spring was “stopped up” or hidden so the Assyrians would not know of it. Still, Gihon was outside Jerusalem’s walls. So how could it keep the Jews alive?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible tells us. It says that Hezekiah “stopped up the upper source of the waters of Gihon and kept them directed straight along down to the west to the city of David.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 20:20</a>) How did he do that? By a water tunnel cut out of solid rock. That tunnel is still there. Experts view it as “one of the great engineering feats of antiquity.” And you as a visitor can wade through it.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It seems that the spring of Gihon (sometimes now called the Virgin’s Fountain) on the lower slope of the Kidron Valley was in a cave. So the ancient Jebusite inhabitants of the city dug out some of the rock at the back and sunk a shaft down from inside the nearby wall. They could thus obtain some water by letting buckets down to the water channel. David’s men may well have sneaked into the city through this shaft. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:8</a>) Yet in Hezekiah’s time the city’s population was much larger. Hence, he undertook the cutting out of a long tunnel that would divert ample water to a pool (Siloam) on the western side of the city inside the protection of the walls. (See the small map.)</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">What an undertaking that was! One team of workers dug from the south, from the pool of Siloam. Another team came from the north, from Gihon. Think of the work involved in chipping​—with hand tools, not with pneumatic drills or modern explosives—​out of solid rock a tunnel averaging about six feet (1.8 meters) high and about two feet (.6 meters) wide. But what is more staggering is its length, 1,749 feet (533 meters). Imagine, through solid rock for almost a third of a mile!</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In that confined area only one man at a time could chip at the tunnel face. So even with ‘round the clock’ crews, it was likely six to eight months before the crews met. Though you cannot speak with any of those dedicated workers to get their impressions of the job, you can come close to that. How so?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Well, back in 1880 a lad playing near the Siloam outlet of the tunnel fell into the water. As he got up he discovered an inscription in the wall. It was carved in early Hebrew and is an invaluable example of the Hebrew writing style of the period, a style such as the prophet Isaiah himself may have used. The space cleared for the inscription was never completely filled, but in part the six lines that were written said:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">“And this was the way in which it was cut through:​—While [. . .] (were) still [. . .] axe(s), each man toward his fellow, and while there were still three cubits to be cut through, [there was heard] the voice of a man calling to his fellow, for there was <em>an overlap</em> in the rock on the right [and on the left]. And when the tunnel was driven <span id="page414" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="414" data-before-text="414"></span>through, the quarrymen hewed (the rock), each man toward his fellow, axe against axe; and the water flowed from the spring toward the reservoir for 1,200 cubits, and the height of the rock above the head(s) of the quarrymen was 100 cubits.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Just think of yourself as one of those workers chipping away deep inside the long, dark tunnel. How would you know in which direction to head? Dig to the right? To the left? Higher? Lower? And yet after many hundreds of feet the workers met​—what an accomplishment!</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Come along, as it were, and see what the tunnel is like, keeping an eye on the accompanying plan. Descending the steps to Gihon (point 1), you find the spring itself (point 2). Then you pass through part of the channel dug by the Jebusites (point 3). If you examine the walls carefully here, you will see that the upper walls and ceiling reflect better craftsmanship. Evidently Hezekiah’s workers reworked some of this section, doing a better job than the earlier Jebusites.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Soon we take a sharp left turn (point 4), where Hezekiah’s tunnel begins. You can move along quite easily. Now you do not have to crawl in a cramped passage with as little as four inches of airspace above the water, as did nineteenth-century archaeologists who explored the tunnel. The deep layer of mud silt that they had to crawl on has now been removed. So you can wade upright, though stooping low in some places. And wade you will, because the gurgling water may be up to your knees or even up to your waist, for it varies in general depth at different times during the day and during different seasons.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">As you move ahead you can tell that you are not following a straight line. No one today knows exactly why the tunnel was dug in an S shape instead of the shorter straight route, but it was. Looping around we come to point 5. Why the abrupt change in direction? Evidently at this point, when the ends were about 100 feet (30 meters) apart, the workers coming from the north first heard the sound of ax blows made by the southern crew. And those coming from the south heard the faint sound of blows when they were at point 12. You can determine this from the tunnel. Both crews began a succession of twists and corrections. Imagine the rising excitement as the men realized that they were approaching one another. Sometimes false echoes may have caused tunneling in a certain direction. But then probably a Hebrew engineer would discern the error and redirect the workers’ efforts. It seems that the crew coming northeast toward Gihon had the greater difficulty, for they made three false starts that had to be abandoned (points 11, 10, 9).</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Reconstructing the scene in your mind’s eye, you can see the worker at the tunnel face chipping away in the dim light. Hearing the chipping blows from the other tunnel, he is tense, excited and now oblivious to the smoke and poor air. Behind him the engineer may crouch, holding a torch and occasionally saying, “More to the left,” or, “In this direction, toward the sound.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Closer and closer the lead workers come. The poorer workmanship of the walls tells you of the workmen’s excitement and impatience. They abandon some of the quality displayed earlier in their tunneling.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">When you get to point 6 you are standing about where the northern crew was when someone heard “the voice of a man calling to his fellow,” as the Siloam inscription relates. Anxious cries must have been exchanged, and then the workers attacked the rock with renewed vigor. The two ends were now only three cubits apart, about four and a half feet (1.4 meters). Look at the slight zigzagging of the walls as the men raced toward one another. Even the floor gives evidence of the mounting <span id="page415" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="415" data-before-text="415"></span>tension, for from points 6 and 8 the floor begins to rise, the workers not cutting as deep.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The voices get louder and louder. Then finally, at point 7, the tip of an ax breaks through. There is a light, and a face! Yes, remarkable as it seems in view of the simple equipment available at the time, the two tunnel projects met as one life-sustaining passageway deep under the City of David. By examining the change of direction in the chipping patterns, you can determine the exact spot of the meeting. And the inscription carved about twenty feet (6 meters) from the Siloam entrance memorializes that feat (point 13). The original stone inscription is now kept in an Istanbul museum. But you can see a plaster copy of it in Jerusalem’s Israel Museum.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">For the cool water to flow from Gihon to the Pool of Siloam, the tunnelers had to make some adjustments in the tunnel floor level at the Siloam end. You can see this, for there the tunnel’s height is more than in the other sections. But once that was done, the water could flow smoothly, with a drop of about seven feet (2.1 meters) over the course of the tunnel’s length. The book <em>The City of David</em> speaks of the “perfectly graduated downward slope from the Spring Gihon to the Pool of Siloam” as “another miracle of ancient technology.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Completing your trip at Siloam, where women wash their clothes in now somewhat more brackish water, you can reflect on the history involved in what you have just experienced. Though the Bible’s mention of Hezekiah’s tunnel was recorded thousands of years ago, you today can bear witness to the historical accuracy of that record. The tunnel through which visitors to Jerusalem can wade testifies to the foresight and diligent work of Hezekiah and the Jews in Jerusalem, when faced with the Assyrian threat.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Still, even though this tunnel was dug to provide an abundance of water to withstand any long enemy siege, King Hezekiah did not rest his trust on such defense preparations. Hezekiah ultimately relied on Jehovah to protect and uphold His worshipers. Strengthened by the prophet Isaiah, King Hezekiah told the people: “Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him. With him there is an arm of flesh, but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">And that He did. While the Jews inside the city were being supplied with water that flowed from Gihon through the tunnel, the Assyrians encamped at some distance from the walls. Then in one night an angel of Jehovah struck down 185,000 Assyrians, “every valiant, mighty man and leader and chief in the camp of the king of Assyria.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976487/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:35</a>) So wading through Hezekiah’s tunnel should do more than bring to mind the history of an engineering project.

The King of the “city of God”, Jesus Christ, was prefigured by King Hezekiah who once throned on Mount Zion at Jerusalem. Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, flooding the land with his hordes of aggression, threatened to besiege the city of God and starve it out until Jehovah’s people in it were obliged to “eat their own excrement and to drink their own urine”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 36:12</a>, <em>AT</em>) But there was a perennial well outside of Jerusalem’s eastern wall, the well of Gihon. Long before Hezekiah’s time an aqueduct had conducted its waters through a tunnel in the rock into the midst of the city. But King Hezekiah saw the peril to the water supply of the city of God. He was not going to let the aggressive Assyrian imperialists seize the vital water source and cut it off from the city. So he bored a more westerly water-tunnel through the rock and covered over the well of Gihon beyond enemy detection.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Concerning this, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:30</a> reports: “This same Hezekiah also stopped [concealed] the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down [by a tunnel] on the west side of the city of David.” (<em>AS</em>) Even the apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus makes mention of this: “Ezechias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst thereof, and he digged a rock with iron, and made a well for water.” (Ecclus. 48:19, <em>Dy</em>) Thus the life-sustaining waters were conducted to the upper pool or Pool of Shiloah (Siloam) and were made secure against the enemy seizure.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1951205/0">a</a> These are doubtless the “waters of Shiloah” which Isaiah’s prophecy (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa 8:6, 7</a>) sets in contrast with the “waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory”.

<strong>Watching the World</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>Tunnel Mystery Hypothesis</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Archaeologists have long wondered why Hezekiah’s tunnel, excavated during the eighth century B.C.E. to assure water for Jerusalem when besieged by the Assyrian army, followed such a haphazard, meandering course. A straight, more efficient route would have taken only 1,050 feet <strong>[320 m]</strong> of digging, instead of the 1,748 feet <strong>[533 m]</strong> the tunnel took. An inscription, written in ancient Hebrew, was found on the tunnel wall in 1880. It explained how two teams of workers started at opposite ends of the rock-hewn tunnel and met in the middle. This raised the additional question of how they managed to do so, considering the tunnel’s wandering route. Geologists now feel they have the answer. According to Dan Gill of the Geological Survey of Israel, the workers followed and widened natural channels formed by water traversing through the rock where cracks occurred under seismic stresses or where different layers met. Over time, these could become quite broad in places, which may explain why the tunnel height varies from 5.5 feet <strong>[1.7 m]</strong> to as much as 16 feet <strong>[5 m]</strong> and also how the workers, using oil lamps, could get enough air. The workers were skillful as well, for the success of the tunnel depended on having a slightly descending slope—a mere 12.5 inches <strong>[31.75 cm]</strong> over the entire course.</p>

The Scriptural account shows that Beth-shan was not among the towns originally occupied by the invading Israelites and that at the time of Saul it was occupied by the Philistines. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Josh. 17:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Judg. 1:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 1 Sam. 31:8-12</a>) The excavations in general support this record and indicate a destruction of Beth-shan sometime after the Israelites’ defeat near Shiloh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Jer. 7:12</a>) Of particular interest was the discovery of certain Canaanite temples at Beth-shan. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">First Samuel 31:10</a> states that the Philistines put King Saul’s armor “in the house of the Ashtoreth images, and his corpse they fastened on the wall or Beth-shan,” while <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 10:10</a> says “they put his armor in the house of their god, and his skull they fastened to the house of Dagon.” Two of the temples unearthed were of the same time period and one gives evidence of being the temple of Ashtoreth, while the other is thought to be that of Dagon, thus harmonizing with the above texts as to the existence of two temples in Beth-shan.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">At Debir (Tell Beit Mirsim) in southern Judah the archaeologists dug through ten strata within an area of seven acres (2.8 hectares). The site showed signs of heavy destruction, followed by what is considered to be evidence of Israelite occupation. Later strata indicated a partial destruction in the time of Sennacherib; signs of two invasions by Nebuchadnezzar were found, with the second showing complete destruction, after which the site continued uninhabited. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Ki. chaps. 24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 25</a>) Debir was also found to have been a major center of the weaving and dyeing industry, with some twenty or more dye plants. On one inscribed pillar unearthed, a Canaanite serpent goddess was depicted.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Ezion-geber, Solomon’s seaport city on the Gulf of Aqabah, excavated during 1937-1940, produced evidence of a copper-smelting site, copper slag and bits of copper ore being found on a low mound in that region. However, the original conclusions of archaeologist Nelson Glueck concerning the site have recently been radically revised by him in an article in <em>The Biblical Archaeologist</em> (Vol. XXVIII, September 1965). His opinion that there was a “blast furnace” system of smelting employed there was based on the finding of what were thought to be “flue-holes” in the principal building excavated. He now has come to the conclusion that these holes in the building’s walls are the result of “the decay and/or burning of wooden beams laid across the width of the walls for bonding or anchoring purposes.” The building, previously thought to be a smelter, is now believed to be a storehouse-granary structure. While it is still believed that metallurgical operations did take place here, they are not now considered to be of the dimensions previously conjectured. This underscores the fact that archaeological data are dependent primarily upon the individual interpretation of the archaeologist, which interpretation is by no means infallible. The Bible itself mentions no copper industry at Ezion-geber, describing only the casting of copper items at a site in the Jordan valley.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">1 Ki. 7:45, 46</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">Hazor in Galilee was described as being “the head of all these kingdoms,” in Joshua’s time.

Solomon fortified the city, and the evidence from that period indicates it to have been a chariot city with stable units and chariot sheds similar to those found at Megiddo.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">Jericho has been subjected to excavations during three different expeditions (1907-1909; 1930-1936; 1952-1958) and the successive interpretations of the findings demonstrate again the fact that archaeology, like other fields of human science, is not a source of positively stable information. Each of the three expeditions has produced data but each has arrived at differing conclusions as to the history of the city and particularly as to the date of its fall before the Israelite conquerors. At any rate, the combined results may be said to present the general picture set forth in the book <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> (1957) by G. Ernest Wright (p. 78), which states: “The city underwent a terrible destruction or a series of destructions between the 16th and 13th centuries B.C., and remained virtually unoccupied for centuries.” The destruction was accompanied by intense fire, as shown by the excavated evidence.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Joshua 6:20-26</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">In Jerusalem in 1867 an old water tunnel was discovered, running from the fountain of Gihon back into the hill behind, with a vertical shaft there leading up into what was once the old city of Jebus. This may illustrate the account of David’s capture of the city at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">2 Samuel 5:6-10</a>. In 1909-1911 the entire system of tunnels connected with the Gihon spring was cleared. One tunnel, known as the Siloam tunnel, averaged six feet (1.8 meters) in height and was cut through solid rock for a distance of some 1,749 feet (533 meters) from Gihon to the pool of Siloam in the Tyropoean Valley (within the city). It thus seems to be the project of King Hezekiah described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:20 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/46/1" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 32:30</a>. Of great interest was the ancient inscription found on the tunnel wall in early Hebrew monumental script describing the cutting of the tunnel and its length. This inscription is used for comparison in dating other Hebrew inscriptions found.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">Lachish, about thirty miles (48 kilometers) SW of Jerusalem, was a principal fortress protecting the Judean hill country. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Jeremiah 34:7</a> the prophet tells of Nebuchadnezzar’s forces fighting against “Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left remaining, against Lachish and against Azekah; for they, the fortified cities, were the ones that remained over among the cities of Judah.” Excavations at Lachish produced evidence of destruction by fire twice within a period of a few years, believed to represent two attacks by the Babylonians (618-617 and 609-607 B.C.E.), after which it lay uninhabited for a long period.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">In the ashes of the second burning were found eighteen ostraca (pieces of pottery inscribed with writing), believed to represent correspondence shortly before the destruction of the city in Nebuchadnezzar’s final assault. Known as the Lachish Letters, these writings reflect a period of crisis and anxiety and appear to have been written from remaining outposts of Judean troops to Yaosh, a military commander in Lachish. Letter number IV contains the statement: <span id="page111" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>“May YHWH [Tetragrammaton, Jehovah] let my lord hear even now tidings of good. . . . we are watching for the signal-stations of Lachish, according to all the signs which my lord gives, because we do not see Azekah.” This passage remarkably expresses the situation described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Jeremiah 34:7</a>, quoted above, and apparently indicates that Azekah had already fallen or at least was failing to send out the fire or smoke signals expected.</p>

Besides building the magnificent temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem, he strengthened Jerusalem’s walls and built extensive fortifications at Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. Archaeologists were guided in their excavation of these fortifications by the Bible’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Kings 9:15</a>: “Now this is the account of those conscripted for forced labor that King Solomon levied to build the house of Jehovah and his own house and the Mound and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer.” They found that the gates of these three last-named cities were all built to a single unique plan, each being fifty-six feet (17 meters) wide, with an entrance flanked on both sides by square towers and leading into a vestibule sixty-six feet (20 meters) long, with three chambers on each side. They were somewhat similar to the description of the gates of Ezekiel’s visionary temple.

These were more thickly and strongly built, doubtless because of the heavy Assyrian battering rams in use during that later period. Other kings of Israel and Judah noted for their construction works are Jeroboam, who rebuilt Shechem and Penuel; Baasha, who began to build Ramah “to allow no one to go out or come in to Asa the king of Judah” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:17</a>); Asa, who used stones and timbers from Ramah in building operations in Geba and Mizpah; Omri the builder of Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom; Uzziah (Azariah) the rebuilder of Elath (Eloth) and builder of towers in the wilderness; and Jotham, who built fortified places and towers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Ki. 12:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 15:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 16:23, 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 14:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/4" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 26:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/5" data-bid="24-6" class="b"> 9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/6" data-bid="24-7" class="b"> 27:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/7" data-bid="24-8" class="b"> 4</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Of Uzziah it is said: “He made in Jerusalem engines of war, the invention of engineers, that they might come to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:15</a>) Just what these engines of war were is not understood. Archaeologists have discovered sculptured reliefs of Sennacherib’s assault on the city of Lachish depicting a defensive innovation that some would attribute to Uzziah. These reliefs show that upon the towers and on the corners of the walls of Lachish wooden structures holding round shields were built above the crenelated parapets. This was a great advantage for the defenders of a city in that they now could stand to full height, with both hands free to shoot arrows and to sling and throw stones at the besiegers, their bodies being much better protected than previously, when they had to expose themselves to shoot, and then dodge behind the merlons of the crenelated walls.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES OF AQUEDUCTS</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">The builders of the Megiddo fortifications used simple, yet ingenious way to get water into the city. The source of water for the city was a well in a natural cave at the western foot of the mound on which Megiddo was built. To get water into the city they sent a vertical shaft ninety-eight feet (30 meters) deep, seventy-two feet (22 meters) of this distance through solid rock, which brought them to the level of the well. From this level they cut a horizontal tunnel with a slight gradient for a distance of 220 feet (67 meters) to the well. The slight slope from the well to the bottom of the shaft allowed the water to flow into the city by gravity. The well was sealed from the outside by a thick wall.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">An amazing construction requiring superb engineering skill was accomplished by Hezekiah when he sealed up the course of the water flowing from Gihon and cut a channel or conduit about 1,750 feet (1,200 cubits or 533 meters) to bring water into Jerusalem, thereby enabling it to withstand a long siege.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:30</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">Often cisterns, both public and individual, were built inside the city so as to have a water supply during times of siege. On the monument (now located in the Louvre of Paris) erected at Dibon, in Moab, by Mesha the king of Moab, we find the inscription “I also built its gates and I built its towers and I built the king’s house, and I made both of its reservoirs for water inside the town. And there was no cistern inside the town even at the acropolis, so I said to all the people, ‘Let each of you make a cistern for himself in his house.’”</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="ss"><strong>SYMBOLIC USES</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Since the tower or citadel of the fortified city was its last stronghold and the towers in the wilderness were the safest places of refuge for miles around, we can see the appropriateness of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a>: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.

<strong>Gihon</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A spring having its fountainhead in a natural cave in the Kidron valley a short distance E of the <span id="page658" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="658" data-before-text="658"></span>upper end of the section of Jerusalem anciently called the “city of David.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:30</a>) It was a principal source of water for the city in ancient times, there being only two springs in the vicinity. The name Gihon is particularly appropriate for this spring inasmuch as it ‘gushes forth’ intermittently, as much as four or five times a day following a rainy winter, less frequently in the dry season.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The spring of Gihon is generally believed to be involved in the method employed by General Joab in penetrating the nearly impregnable Jebusite stronghold at Jerusalem, making possible its capture by David. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 11:6</a>) Although the translation of the Hebrew text at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Samuel 5:8</a> presents certain problems, the usual rendering indicates the presence of a “water tunnel,” referred to by David when promoting the attack on the city. In 1867 C.E. Charles Warren discovered a water channel running back from the cave in which the spring of Gihon rises, and, after a distance of some fifty feet (15 meters), ending in a pool or reservoir. A vertical shaft cut in the rock above this pool extended upward forty feet (12 meters), and at the top of the shaft there was a place where persons could stand and let down containers by rope to draw water from the pool below. A hook-shaped, sloping passageway led back nearly 150 feet (46 meters) from the shaft up into the interior of the city. By this means it is believed that the Jebusites maintained access to their water source even when unable to venture outside the city walls due to enemy attack. Although the spring of Gihon is not directly mentioned in the account, it is suggested that Joab and his men daringly gained entrance to the city through this water tunnel.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Gihon was thereafter the site at which Solomon was anointed as king at David’s command. The ensuing noisy procession as the people joyously followed Solomon back to the city, while not visible from the spring called En-rogel, some 1,400 feet (427 meters) away from Gihon, could easily be heard by presumptuous Adonijah and his guests as they banqueted at En-rogel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 33-41</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Archaeological excavations also revealed an old surface canal leading from the spring of Gihon southward along the slope of the “city of David.” This canal terminated in a pool at the base of the spur on which the ancient city was first located, at the spur’s southern end, toward the junction of the Tyropean valley with the Kidron valley. The canal was constructed with a minimal decline or rate of fall, resulting in a very gentle flow of water. This canal is probably the one referred to by Isaiah’s prophecy in the time of King Ahaz (761-745 B.C.E.), its ‘gently-going waters, being contrasted with the violent flood of invading Assyrians that Isaiah foretold would eventually attack Judah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 8:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When the time of the Assyrian attack became imminent in Hezekiah’s reign (732 B.C.E.), King Hezekiah took measures to ensure that Jerusalem’s supply of water would not be cut off by the invading enemy. The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:2-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 30</a> shows that he shut off the flow of the Gihon through its previous channel and diverted the waters to the western side of the “city of David,” well within Jerusalem’s fortifications. Evidence of the manner in which this was accomplished came to light in 1880 C.E. when an inscription was found carved in the wall of a water tunnel terminating in what is presently known as the Pool of Siloam on the W side of the old “city of David.” The inscription, in early Hebrew script considered as dating from the eighth century B.C.E., described the excavation of the tunnel through solid rock by the two teams of men working toward each other from opposite ends. When the tunnel was completely cleared in 1910 it was found to measure some 1,749 feet (533 meters), with an average height of nearly six feet (2 meters) and at times narrowing to a width of only twenty inches (51 centimeters). It seems evident that this remarkable engineering feat is the result of Hezekiah’s measures to protect and maintain Jerusalem’s water supply originating in the Gihon.—See SILOAM.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">King Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, extended Jerusalem’s fortifications during his reign (716-661 B.C.E.), building an outer wall for the “city of David” to the “west of Gihon,” hence not enclosing the spring of Gihon within its limits.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011654/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 33:14</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The Gihon’s waters continue to flow today through the “Siloam Tunnel,” credited to Hezekiah.</p>

<strong>Hezekiah</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">At Hezekiah’s accession to the throne of Judah, the <span id="page763" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="763" data-before-text="763"></span>northern ten-tribe kingdom of Israel was in even worse condition. For their gross sins Jehovah had allowed them to come into dire straits, becoming tributary to Assyria, and it would not be long until Assyria would swallow up Israel and carry her people into captivity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:5-23</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>HIS ZEAL FOR TRUE WORSHIP</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Hezekiah demonstrated his zeal for Jehovah’s worship immediately on taking the throne at the age of twenty-five years. His first act was to reopen and repair the temple. Then, calling together the priests and Levites, he said to them: “It is close to my heart to conclude a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel.” This was a covenant of faithfulness, as though the Law covenant, still in effect but neglected, was inaugurated anew in Judah. With great energy he proceeded to organize the Levites in their services, and reestablished the arrangements for musical instruments and singing of praises. It was Nisan, the month for Passover to be celebrated, but the temple and the priests and Levites were unclean. By the sixteenth day of Nisan the temple was cleansed and its utensils restored. Then a special atonement had to be made for all Israel. First, the princes brought sacrifices, sin offerings for the kingdom, the sanctuary and the people, followed by thousands of burnt offerings by the people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:1-36</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Since the people’s uncleanness prevented their observance of the Passover at the regular time, Hezekiah took advantage of the law that allowed those who are unclean to celebrate the Passover one month later. He called, not only Judah, but also Israel, by means of letters sent by runners throughout the land from Beer-sheba to Dan. The runners met with derision from many; but individuals, particularly from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun, humbled themselves to come, some from Ephraim and Issachar also attending. Besides this, many non-Israelite worshipers of Jehovah were on hand. It was likely a difficult matter for those in the northern kingdom who stood for true worship to attend. They, like the messengers, would meet opposition and ridicule, inasmuch as the ten-tribe kingdom was in a decadent state, sunk in false worship and harassed by the Assyrian menace.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:1-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Num. 9:10-13</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">After the Passover, the Festival of Unfermented Cakes was held for seven days with such attendant joy that the entire congregation decided to extend it seven days longer. Even in such perilous times Jehovah’s blessing prevailed so that “there came to be great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon the son of David the king of Israel there was none like this in Jerusalem.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:21-27</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">That this was a real restoration and revival of true worship and not merely a transient emotional gathering is seen in what followed. Before their return home the celebrants went out and destroyed the sacred pillars, pulled down the high places and the altars and cut down the sacred poles throughout Judah and Benjamin and even in Ephraim and Manasseh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:1</a>) Hezekiah set the example by crushing to pieces the copper serpent that Moses had made, because the people had made it an idol, burning sacrificial smoke to it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:4</a>) After the great festival, Hezekiah ensured the continuation of true worship by organizing the priestly divisions and arranging for the support of the temple services by the enforcement of the Law as to the tithes and firstfruit contributions to the Levites and priests, to which the people responded wholeheartedly.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:2-12</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>ASSYRIAN PRESSURE BUILDS UP</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In those strenuous times, when Assyria was sweeping everything in its path, Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and struck down the Philistine cities, which had evidently become allied with Assyria. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:7, 8</a>) Even though it was during this time that Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia (usually associated with Pharaoh Taharka, an Ethiopian who ruled Egypt) was a threat to Assyria’s domination of Palestine, Hezekiah never went “down to Egypt for assistance” by trusting in and making alliances with him. In this he was doubtless strengthened by the prophet Isaiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 31:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:5-9</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">It was in Hezekiah’s third year that Shalmaneser of Assyria began the siege of Samaria. After holding out for three years, Samaria was taken, perhaps by Sargon II, Shalmaneser’s successor, in 740 B.C.E. The people of the ten-tribe kingdom were deported, the Assyrians moving in others to occupy the land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:9-12</a>) This left the kingdom of Judah, representing God’s theocratic government and true worship, like a small island surrounded by hostile enemies.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Sennacherib, Sargon’s son, was ambitious to add the conquest of Jerusalem to his trophies of war, especially in view of the fact that Hezekiah had withdrawn from the alliance that had been entered into with Assyria by his father King Ahaz. In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s reign (732 B.C.E.) Sennacherib “came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and proceeded to seize them.” Hezekiah offered to buy Sennacherib off to save the threatened city of Jerusalem, whereupon Sennacherib demanded the enormous sum of 300 silver talents and 30 gold talents (more than one and a half million dollars, according to gold and silver prices in 1965). To pay this amount, Hezekiah was obliged to give all the silver that was found in the temple and the royal treasury, besides the precious metals that Hezekiah himself had caused to be overlaid on the temple doors and posts. This satisfied the king of Assyria, but only temporarily.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-16</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>BUILDING AND ENGINEERING WORKS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In the face of imminent attack by greedy Sennacherib, Hezekiah displayed wisdom and military strategy. He stopped up all the springs and water sources outside the city of Jerusalem, so that, in event of a siege, the Assyrians would be short on water supplies. He strengthened the city’s fortifications and, “made missiles in abundance and shields.” But his trust was not in this military equipment, for in gathering together the military chieftains and the people, he encouraged them, saying: “Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him. With him there is an arm of flesh, but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011961/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">One of the outstanding engineering feats of ancient times was the aqueduct of Hezekiah. It ran from the well of Gihon E of the northern part of the city of David in a rather irregular course, extending 1,749 feet (533 meters) to the Pool of Siloam in the Tyropean Valley below the city of David but within a new wall added to the S part of the city.

The inscription reads, in part: “And this was the way in which it was cut through:—While [. . . ] (were) still [. . . ] axe(s), each man toward his fellow, and while there were still three cubits to be cut through, [there was heard] the voice of a man calling to his fellow, for there was <em>an overlap</em> in the rock on the right [and on the left]. And when the tunnel was driven through, the quarrymen hewed (the rock), each man toward his fellow, axe against axe; and the water flowed from the spring toward the reservoir for 1,200 cubits, and the height of the rock above the head(s) of the quarrymen was 100 cubits.” (<em>Ancient Near Eastern Text</em>, Pritchard, p. 321) So the tunnel was cut through the rock from both ends, meeting in the middle—a real engineering accomplishment.</p>

On one occasion, however, David saw fit to abandon the city before the advance of rebel forces led by his own son, Absalom. The king’s retreat may have been to avoid having blood shed in civil war at this place where Jehovah’s name rested.

The hewn stones prepared may have been quarried in that area, for the bedrock of Jerusalem itself is easily cut and chiseled to size and shape, yet, upon exposure to the weather, hardens into durable and attractive building stones.

Another son, Adonijah, was at the spring of En-rogel, plotting to seize the kingship, when Solomon was anointed by the spring of Gihon. The distance between the two points was short enough (less than a third of a mile [less than 500 meters]) that Adonijah and his coconspirators heard the noise of the horn and celebrations at Gihon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:5-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 32-41</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Solomon’s reign saw considerable building (and perhaps rebuilding) done within the city and expansion of its limits.

Within five years of Solomon’s death, the city experienced the first of a number of invasions. King Shishak of Egypt attacked the kingdom of Judah, doubtless viewing it as vulnerable in its reduced state. Because of national unfaithfulness, he succeeded in entering Jerusalem, carrying off temple treasures and other valuables. Only because of repentance was a measure of divine protection granted, preventing actual ruin to the city.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1 Ki. 14:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 12:2-12</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">During faithful King Asa’s reign, King Baasha of the northern kingdom made an unsuccessful attempt to build up strength on Judah’s northern frontier to seal it off and prevent communication with Jerusalem (and possibly expressions of loyalty to the Judean kingdom by any of his subjects).

True worship brought Jehovah’s blessing and protection; apostasy led to grave problems and vulnerability to attack. The reign of Jehoshaphat’s unfaithful son Jehoram (913-906 B.C.E.) saw the city invaded and looted a second time by an Arab-Philistine combine, this despite the strong defense walls.

(See ARCHAEOLOGY, p. 110.) At any rate, the city’s strength lay not in its defensive systems and supplies, but in the protective power of Jehovah God, who said: “And I shall certainly defend this city to save it for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:32-34</a>) The miraculous destruction of 185,000 Assyrian troops sent Sennacherib scurrying back to Assyria. <span id="page912" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="912" data-before-text="912"></span>(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:35, 36</a>) When the campaign account was recorded in the Assyrian annals, it boasted of Sennacherib’s shutting Hezekiah up inside Jerusalem like a ‘bird in a cage,’ but made no claim of capturing the city.—See SENNACHERIB.</p>

Because the discomfiture and defeat of Sisera and his forces took place on the plains of Megiddo, the first of the battles to make that place famous and which battles have served as symbols of the battle of the great day of God the Almighty, Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 16</a>) This is further borne out by the prophetic prayer of the psalmist: “Do to them as to . . . Sisera, as to Jabin at the torrent valley of Kishon. They were annihilated <span id="page477" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="477" data-before-text="477"></span>at Endor; they became manure for the ground.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 83:9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 25:33</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Since the one successfully fighting the battle at Armageddon for Jehovah and his name will be Jesus Christ, together with his heavenly hosts, it follows that Barak pictures Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 2:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 19:11-21</a>) King Jabin of Canaan, chief oppressor of Israel, would well picture Satan the Devil, the chief oppressor of God’s people, while his agents on earth that do his bidding would well be pictured by General Sisera. What about Jael? Whom does she picture?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Not being of the nation of Israel, she would picture someone else than the spiritual Israelites. Logically she would picture the “great crowd” that the apostle John saw after he had seen the 144,000 of spiritual Israel, and which crowd came out of all nations, peoples and languages. These share in praising Jehovah God and show their loyalty to the greater Barak, Jesus Christ, and to spiritual Israel by treating Satan’s agents as dead.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9-17</a>.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966566/1">b</a></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Truly, what was written aforetime does serve to strengthen our faith, encouraging us and throwing light on our pathway!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>.</p>

<strong>Burial, Burial Places</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The location of these royal burial places has not been determined. On the basis of the reference to “the Burial Places of David” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000842/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:16</a> and the mention of “the ascent to the burial places of the sons of David” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000842/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>, some believe the likely location to have been on the SE hill of the city near the Kidron Valley. A number of what appear to be ancient rock-cut tombs have been found in this area, their entrances being in the form of sunken rectangular shafts. However, no positive identification can be made; any effort at identification was complicated not only by the destruction of the city in the year 70 C.E. and again in 135 C.E. but also by the use of the southern part of the city by the Romans as a stone quarry. Hence, the above-mentioned tombs are in a greatly deteriorated state.</p>

By turning back his people to the law of Jehovah God, Josiah tried to do what he could to prevent national calamity from coming upon them. When he inquired through the prophetess Huldah what the future held for his nation, Josiah was given this promise from God: “Here I am gathering you to your forefathers, and you will certainly be gathered to your own graveyard in peace, and your eyes will not look upon all the calamity that I am bringing upon this place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:20</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Josiah died from a wound received in battle at Megiddo. So it was not during the terrible calamity that was to come upon Jerusalem. After Josiah was fatally wounded, “his servants took him down from the chariot and had him ride in the second war chariot that was his and brought him to Jerusalem. Thus he died and was buried in the graveyard of his forefathers; and all Judah and Jerusalem were mourning over Josiah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:22-24</a>) Not all the kings of Jerusalem who preceded Josiah were buried in the same place at Jerusalem, in the “burial places of the kings of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Chron. 28:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 21:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 24:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/4" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 16:14</a>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">31, 32.

<strong>Pay Attention to Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For outstanding proof of the need to pay attention to prophecy, let us look briefly into a section of history near the end of the kingdom of Judah, ruled by kings of the line of David. We break in at the time of King Manasseh, fourteenth king after David. Succeeding his father, good King Hezekiah, to the throne, he ruled for fifty-five years. He had ample opportunity to know the history of the nation and the prophecies that Jehovah had caused to be fulfilled toward his forefathers. God had prophesied concerning any king on the throne of David: “When he does wrong, I will also reprove him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of Adam.” Directly contrary to God’s word and prophecy, Manasseh turned to Babylonish religion, such as astrology, magic, omens, sorcery, divinations and <span id="page602" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="602" data-before-text="602"></span>professional foretellers of events. He even performed human sacrifice, of his own royal sons, to the Canaanite god Baal. He set up altars for the worship of the sun, moon and stars in two courtyards of Jehovah’s own temple in Jerusalem, and also set up “the carved image that he had made” in this holy temple. God’s prophecy, therefore, came true on him through the heavy hand of Assyria, the Second World Power, as God’s instrument to fulfill the prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 33:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But Manasseh’s contempt for God’s word through Moses and his other prophets brought more than punishment on Manasseh himself. His rebelliousness led Judah to act more wickedly than the pagan inhabitants of the land. Jehovah God sent a stinging prophecy that should have opened his ears: “Here I am bringing a calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah, of which if anyone hears both his ears will tingle. . . . and I shall simply wipe Jerusalem clean just as one wipes the handleless bowl clean, wiping it clean and turning it upside down. And I shall indeed forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:10-15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Manasseh’s stubborn course resulted in the shedding of innocent blood in the land “in very great quantity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:16</a>) This, according to the literature of the Jewish rabbis, included the blood of Isaiah, whom they say was sawed apart at King Manasseh’s command. Manasseh despised a very similar prophecy that Isaiah brought from Jehovah stating: “Look! Jehovah is emptying the land and laying it waste, and he has twisted the face of it and scattered its inhabitants. . . . Without fail the land will be emptied, and without fail it will be plundered, for Jehovah himself has spoken this word. The land has gone to mourning, has faded away. . . . And the very land has been polluted under its inhabitants, for they have bypassed the laws, changed the regulation, broken the indefinitely lasting covenant [based on the Ten Commandments]. That is why the curse itself has eaten up the land, and those inhabiting it are held guilty. . . . And its transgression has become heavy upon it, and it must fall.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 24:1-20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Manasseh’s acts of wickedness caused God to determine that now Jerusalem and the land of Judah were so defiled that they could not escape being emptied and desolated for a period of time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Ki. 23:26, 27</a>) But, for ignoring God’s word and prophecy, Manasseh first had to be punished. We read: “Jehovah kept speaking to Manasseh and his people, but they <em>paid no attention.</em> Finally Jehovah brought against them the chiefs of the army that belonged to the king of Assyria,<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964728/0">a</a> and so they captured Manasseh . . . and took him to Babylon [which the king of Assyria had made one of his residences].” Manasseh’s subsequent repentance and attempt to restore true worship and God’s response with mercy to him are recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:10-17</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>ATTENTION TO PROPHECY BRINGS PROTECTION</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Manasseh was succeeded by his son Amon, who resumed pagan idolatry. He was murdered, but the people loyally stuck to the house of David and put his eight-year-old son Josiah upon the throne. Thus David’s line retained the throne, as God had prophesied. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:18-25</a>) At nineteen years of age King Josiah began to cleanse the whole kingdom of false worship. He paid attention to Jehovah’s prophets.

Josiah saw Assyria itself fall in 633 <span id="page603" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="603" data-before-text="603"></span>B.C.E., fulfilling the prophecy of Nahum concerning Nineveh, capital of Assyria, which was destroyed by the kingdom of Media and its allies.

For instance, one of the Ras Shamra texts mentions an offering to “Queen Shapash (the Sun) and to the stars,” and another alludes to “the army of the sun and the host of the day.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">It is, therefore, noteworthy that the Bible makes several references to the heavenly bodies in connection with Baal worship. Describing the wayward course of the kingdom of Israel, the Scriptural record states: “They kept leaving all the commandments of Jehovah . . . , and they began to bow down to all the army of the heavens and to serve Baal.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000505/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2Ki 17:16</a>) Concerning the kingdom of Judah, it is noted that right in the temple of Jehovah there came to be “utensils made for Baal and for the sacred pole and for all the army of the heavens.” Also, the people throughout Judah made “sacrificial smoke to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations of the zodiac and to all the army of the heavens.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000505/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2Ki 23:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000505/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 2Ch 33:3</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000505/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Zep 1:4, 5</a>.</p>

<strong>Pay Attention to Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For outstanding proof of the need to pay attention to prophecy, let us look briefly into a section of history near the end of the kingdom of Judah, ruled by kings of the line of David. We break in at the time of King Manasseh, fourteenth king after David. Succeeding his father, good King Hezekiah, to the throne, he ruled for fifty-five years. He had ample opportunity to know the history of the nation and the prophecies that Jehovah had caused to be fulfilled toward his forefathers. God had prophesied concerning any king on the throne of David: “When he does wrong, I will also reprove him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of Adam.” Directly contrary to God’s word and prophecy, Manasseh turned to Babylonish religion, such as astrology, magic, omens, sorcery, divinations and <span id="page602" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="602" data-before-text="602"></span>professional foretellers of events. He even performed human sacrifice, of his own royal sons, to the Canaanite god Baal. He set up altars for the worship of the sun, moon and stars in two courtyards of Jehovah’s own temple in Jerusalem, and also set up “the carved image that he had made” in this holy temple. God’s prophecy, therefore, came true on him through the heavy hand of Assyria, the Second World Power, as God’s instrument to fulfill the prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 33:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But Manasseh’s contempt for God’s word through Moses and his other prophets brought more than punishment on Manasseh himself. His rebelliousness led Judah to act more wickedly than the pagan inhabitants of the land. Jehovah God sent a stinging prophecy that should have opened his ears: “Here I am bringing a calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah, of which if anyone hears both his ears will tingle. . . . and I shall simply wipe Jerusalem clean just as one wipes the handleless bowl clean, wiping it clean and turning it upside down. And I shall indeed forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:10-15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Manasseh’s stubborn course resulted in the shedding of innocent blood in the land “in very great quantity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:16</a>) This, according to the literature of the Jewish rabbis, included the blood of Isaiah, whom they say was sawed apart at King Manasseh’s command. Manasseh despised a very similar prophecy that Isaiah brought from Jehovah stating: “Look! Jehovah is emptying the land and laying it waste, and he has twisted the face of it and scattered its inhabitants. . . . Without fail the land will be emptied, and without fail it will be plundered, for Jehovah himself has spoken this word. The land has gone to mourning, has faded away. . . . And the very land has been polluted under its inhabitants, for they have bypassed the laws, changed the regulation, broken the indefinitely lasting covenant [based on the Ten Commandments]. That is why the curse itself has eaten up the land, and those inhabiting it are held guilty. . . . And its transgression has become heavy upon it, and it must fall.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 24:1-20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Manasseh’s acts of wickedness caused God to determine that now Jerusalem and the land of Judah were so defiled that they could not escape being emptied and desolated for a period of time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Ki. 23:26, 27</a>) But, for ignoring God’s word and prophecy, Manasseh first had to be punished. We read: “Jehovah kept speaking to Manasseh and his people, but they <em>paid no attention.</em> Finally Jehovah brought against them the chiefs of the army that belonged to the king of Assyria,<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964728/0">a</a> and so they captured Manasseh . . . and took him to Babylon [which the king of Assyria had made one of his residences].” Manasseh’s subsequent repentance and attempt to restore true worship and God’s response with mercy to him are recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:10-17</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>ATTENTION TO PROPHECY BRINGS PROTECTION</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Manasseh was succeeded by his son Amon, who resumed pagan idolatry. He was murdered, but the people loyally stuck to the house of David and put his eight-year-old son Josiah upon the throne. Thus David’s line retained the throne, as God had prophesied. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:18-25</a>) At nineteen years of age King Josiah began to cleanse the whole kingdom of false worship. He paid attention to Jehovah’s prophets. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:1-7</a>) Therefore the Second World Power, Assyria, was never able to take Judah and Jerusalem into captivity. Josiah saw Assyria itself fall in 633 <span id="page603" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="603" data-before-text="603"></span>B.C.E., fulfilling the prophecy of Nahum concerning Nineveh, capital of Assyria, which was destroyed by the kingdom of Media and its allies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Nah. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 1:15</a>) This proves that Jehovah the God of prophecy is true and is the Universal Sovereign.</p>

A recent archaeological find at the ancient Phoenician city of Carthage (now a suburb of Tunis in Tunisia, North Africa) has shed some light on the depth of depravity of this practice.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The site was first discovered in 1921. But starting in the 1970’s, intensive excavation was done because of the expansion of the modern city toward the area. The dig turned out to be a huge burial ground for the remains of sacrificed children. The journal <em>Biblical Archaeology Review</em> reports:</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Here, from the eighth century B.C. until the second century B.C., mothers and fathers of Carthage buried the bones of their children sacrificed to the god Ba’al Hammon and to the goddess Tanit. By the fourth century B.C. the Tophet [from Biblical Topheth] may have been as large as 64,800 square feet (6,000 square meters), with nine levels of burials.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Similar sites have been discovered in Sicily, in Sardinia, and elsewhere in Tunisia. At one time, all had been Phoenician colonies. In the Carthaginian burial ground, the researchers found numerous stone markers inscribed with figures of the goddess Tanit, who has been identified with the Canaanite goddess Ashtoreth, or Astarte, the wife of Baal. Underneath the markers are found earthen urns, some brightly decorated, that contain the charred bones of the sacrificial victims.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As an indication of the extent of the practice, the report says: “Using the density of urns in our excavated area as a standard, we estimate that as many as 20,000 urns may have been deposited there between 400 and 200 B.C.” This enormous number is made all the more shocking when one bears in mind that in its heyday the population of Carthage, according to the article, was only about 250,000.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Inscriptions on the stone markers show that children were sacrificed to fulfill vows their parents made to Baal or Tanit in exchange for favors. Ranks and titles on the markers indicate that the practice was particularly popular with the upper class, evidently to invoke the blessing of the gods on their efforts to achieve and maintain their wealth and influence. Some of the urns were found to contain the remains of two or three children, possibly of the same family, judging from the age differences.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">If the practice of the Phoenicians is shocking, then remember that “Manasseh kept seducing Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do worse than the nations that Jehovah had annihilated from before the sons of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986728/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:9</a>) It was no exaggeration when Jehovah said: “They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986728/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jeremiah 19:4</a>) Appropriately, the <em>Review</em> article observes: “The growing body of archaeological and epigraphic evidence, provided by the Carthaginians themselves, strongly suggests that the classical and Biblical writers knew what they were talking about.”</p>

In the past some have thought that this reference to Babylon was in error, considering Nineveh to be the place to which Manasseh would be taken. However, as has been seen, Esar-haddon, whose inscriptions show him to have been contemporaneous with Manasseh, had rebuilt Babylon and is said to have been “much less interested than any other Assyrian king in the embellishment of his capital, Nineveh.” (<em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,</em> edited by G. Buttrick, 1962, Vol. 2, p. 125) If it was during Esar-haddon’s reign that Manasseh was captured, there would be nothing incongruous about his being taken to Babylon, about whose restoration Esar-haddon so proudly boasted. It may be noted, however, that Esar-haddon’s son Ashurbanipal also makes reference to Manasseh as tributary during his reign.</p>

<strong>Pay Attention to Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For outstanding proof of the need to pay attention to prophecy, let us look briefly into a section of history near the end of the kingdom of Judah, ruled by kings of the line of David. We break in at the time of King Manasseh, fourteenth king after David. Succeeding his father, good King Hezekiah, to the throne, he ruled for fifty-five years. He had ample opportunity to know the history of the nation and the prophecies that Jehovah had caused to be fulfilled toward his forefathers. God had prophesied concerning any king on the throne of David: “When he does wrong, I will also reprove him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of Adam.” Directly contrary to God’s word and prophecy, Manasseh turned to Babylonish religion, such as astrology, magic, omens, sorcery, divinations and <span id="page602" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="602" data-before-text="602"></span>professional foretellers of events. He even performed human sacrifice, of his own royal sons, to the Canaanite god Baal. He set up altars for the worship of the sun, moon and stars in two courtyards of Jehovah’s own temple in Jerusalem, and also set up “the carved image that he had made” in this holy temple. God’s prophecy, therefore, came true on him through the heavy hand of Assyria, the Second World Power, as God’s instrument to fulfill the prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 33:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But Manasseh’s contempt for God’s word through Moses and his other prophets brought more than punishment on Manasseh himself. His rebelliousness led Judah to act more wickedly than the pagan inhabitants of the land. Jehovah God sent a stinging prophecy that should have opened his ears: “Here I am bringing a calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah, of which if anyone hears both his ears will tingle. . . . and I shall simply wipe Jerusalem clean just as one wipes the handleless bowl clean, wiping it clean and turning it upside down. And I shall indeed forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:10-15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Manasseh’s stubborn course resulted in the shedding of innocent blood in the land “in very great quantity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:16</a>) This, according to the literature of the Jewish rabbis, included the blood of Isaiah, whom they say was sawed apart at King Manasseh’s command. Manasseh despised a very similar prophecy that Isaiah brought from Jehovah stating: “Look! Jehovah is emptying the land and laying it waste, and he has twisted the face of it and scattered its inhabitants. . . . Without fail the land will be emptied, and without fail it will be plundered, for Jehovah himself has spoken this word. The land has gone to mourning, has faded away. . . . And the very land has been polluted under its inhabitants, for they have bypassed the laws, changed the regulation, broken the indefinitely lasting covenant [based on the Ten Commandments]. That is why the curse itself has eaten up the land, and those inhabiting it are held guilty. . . . And its transgression has become heavy upon it, and it must fall.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 24:1-20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Manasseh’s acts of wickedness caused God to determine that now Jerusalem and the land of Judah were so defiled that they could not escape being emptied and desolated for a period of time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Ki. 23:26, 27</a>) But, for ignoring God’s word and prophecy, Manasseh first had to be punished. We read: “Jehovah kept speaking to Manasseh and his people, but they <em>paid no attention.</em> Finally Jehovah brought against them the chiefs of the army that belonged to the king of Assyria,<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964728/0">a</a> and so they captured Manasseh . . . and took him to Babylon [which the king of Assyria had made one of his residences].” Manasseh’s subsequent repentance and attempt to restore true worship and God’s response with mercy to him are recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:10-17</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>ATTENTION TO PROPHECY BRINGS PROTECTION</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Manasseh was succeeded by his son Amon, who resumed pagan idolatry. He was murdered, but the people loyally stuck to the house of David and put his eight-year-old son Josiah upon the throne. Thus David’s line retained the throne, as God had prophesied. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:18-25</a>) At nineteen years of age King Josiah began to cleanse the whole kingdom of false worship.

Josiah saw Assyria itself fall in 633 <span id="page603" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="603" data-before-text="603"></span>B.C.E., fulfilling the prophecy of Nahum concerning Nineveh, capital of Assyria, which was destroyed by the kingdom of Media and its allies.

<strong>Assyria</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">It was during the reign of Menahem of Israel (791-780 B.C.E.) that Tiglath-pileser III entered the domain of that northern kingdom. Menahem made a payment to him of one thousand silver talents (about $1,423,590) and thus obtained the withdrawal of the Assyrian. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Ki. 15:19, 20</a>) Later, however, King Pekah of Israel (778-758 B.C.E.) joined together with King Rezin of Syria against Judean King Ahaz (761-745 B.C.E.). Despite Isaiah’s prophecy foretelling the certain elimination of this Syro-Israelite threat through the power of the king of Assyria (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 7:1-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 8:3, 4</a>), Ahaz chose the unwise course of sending a bribe to Tiglath-pileser so that he might attack that combine and thus relieve the pressure upon Judah. The Assyrian monarch responded by capturing a number of cities in the northern part of the kingdom of Israel, as well as the regions of Gilead, Galilee and Naphtali. Earlier in his reign, Tiglath-pileser III had Inaugurated the policy of transplanting the populations of conquered areas, thus to reduce the possibility of future uprisings, and he now proceeded to deport some of the Israelites.

He put down an uprising in Egypt and sacked the city of Thebes (No-amon; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Nahum 3:7, 8</a>). The boundaries of the Assyrian Empire now embraced the regions of Elam, part of Media up into Ararat, as far W as Cilicia in Asia Minor, through Syria and Palestine, down into Egypt, Arabia, and Babylonia. He appears to be the “great and honorable Asenappar” referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010447/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ezra 4:10</a>.—See ASENAPPAR.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Prior to Esar-haddon’s death he had appointed his son Ashurbanipal as ‘king of the realm’ and another son, Shamashshumukin, as king of Babylon. Shamashshumukin later rebelled against his brother, and Ashurbanipal overcame the rebellion and sacked the city of Babylon. The remainder of Ashurbanipal’s reign, and, in fact, that of the Assyrian Empire, is obscure. Commenting on this <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible</em> (Vol. 1, p. 274) says: “Whether this fight taxed the strength of Assyria too much or whether it was for other, unknown reasons, a strange period of silence blacks out the last twenty years of the reign of Ashurbanipal. . . . the country seems to have fallen with appalling suddenness into obscurity.”</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">As will be noted in our article on NINEVEH, we have accepted the year 632 B.C.E. as the probable date for the fall of Nineveh, whereas most reference <span id="page155" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="155" data-before-text="155"></span>works place it at the year 612 B.C.E., or some twenty years thereafter. The uncertainty of the history of that period as found in secular records is acknowledged, and, as is demonstrated in our article on CHRONOLOGY, we have relied on the chronological framework indicated in the Bible record and have accommodated secular history to it, rather than give precedence to what may be presently accepted and popular in the way of chronology but which is often conjectural or based on evidence that is undeniably weak.</p>

<strong>Esar-haddon</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>Esar-haddon states that, prior to his father’s death, he had already been selected as heir apparent (after due consultation of the gods and liver-divination), and he seems to have served as viceroy at Babylon before becoming king of Assyria. Following his father’s assassination, Esar-haddon tells of pursuing the murderers to Armenia (the “land of Ararat,” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:37</a>), where he defeated them. His official reign is considered to have lasted twelve years.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Early in his reign Esar-haddon began the restoration of Babylon, which Sennacherib had destroyed. The temple of Esagila was restored and, of the city itself, Esar-haddon says: “Babylon I built anew, I enlarged, I raised aloft, I made magnificent.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">His records recount military operations against the <em>Gimirrai</em> or Cimmerians, believed to be the descendants of Gomer. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 10:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 38:6</a>.) He also sacked the city of Sidon, setting up a new city on a nearby site, which he named Kar—Esar-haddon. In one of his inscriptions he lists some twenty vassal kings, including Manasseh of Judah (<em>Menasi</em> king of <em>Yaudi</em>).</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:10-13</a> shows that Manasseh was captured by “the chiefs of the army that belonged to the king of Assyria” and taken to Babylon. In the past some have thought this reference to Babylon to be in error, considering Nineveh to be the place to which Manasseh would be taken. However, as has been seen, Esar-haddon, whose inscriptions show him to have been contemporaneous with Manasseh, had rebuilt Babylon and is said to have been “much less interested than any other Assyrian king in the embellishment of his capital, Nineveh.” (<em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,</em> Vol. 2, page 125) If it was during Esar-haddon’s reign that Manasseh was captured, there would be nothing incongruous about his being taken to Babylon, about whose restoration Esar-haddon so proudly boasted. It may be noted, however, that Esar-haddon’s son Ashurbanipal also makes reference to Manasseh as tributary during his reign.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>THE “SIXTY-FIVE YEARS”</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">At the time of the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem some of the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land referred to their having been brought to Palestine by “Esar-haddon the king of Assyria.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 4:2</a>) That the Assyrian transplantation of people to and from Palestine continued till his reign is viewed by some as a clue to the understanding of the period of “sixty-five years” stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:8</a> with regard to the desolation of Ephraim (with its capital at Samaria). The interval extending from the reign of Tiglath-pileser III (who initiated the deportation of people from the northern kingdom of Israel shortly after Isaiah’s prophecy) to that of Esar-haddon would allow for such a sixty-five-year period until the complete ‘shattering to pieces’ of Ephraim “so as not to be a people.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>CONQUEST OF EGYPT, AND ESAR-HADDON’S DEATH</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Esar-haddon’s outstanding military accomplishment was the conquest of Egypt, overcoming the Egyptian army under Ethiopian ruler Tirhakah (mentioned as the “king of Ethiopia” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Kings 19:9</a>) and taking the city of Memphis. Esar-haddon thus added to his many titles that of “King of the kings of Egypt.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Although Esar-haddon organized Egypt into districts and placed Assyrian governors over the princes of these districts, within a couple of years revolt developed. The Assyrian king set out on a second campaign to crush the rebellion, but died at Haran while on the way. In his inscriptions Esar-haddon had said: “I am powerful, I am all powerful. I am a hero, I am gigantic, I am colossal.” Yet, like all other imperfect humans, he was shown to be but an enslaved subject of the rule of Kings Sin and Death, who now claimed him.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 9:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011374/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Romans 5:21</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Before his death Esar-haddon had made arrangements to ensure a smooth succession to the throne by proclaiming his son Ashurbanipal as crown prince, while assigning another son, Shamash-shum-ukin, as king of Babylon. Thus, upon Esar-haddon’s death, Ashurbanipal became Assyria’s next monarch.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

There he repented. The Scriptures report: “He softened the face of Jehovah his God and kept humbling himself greatly because of the God of his forefathers. And he kept praying to Him, so that He let himself be entreated by him and He heard his request for favor and restored him to Jerusalem to his kingship.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977847/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:12, 13</a>) Thereafter Manasseh did what he could to rectify his wrongs, clearing out idolatrous practices from his realm, sacrificing to Jehovah and encouraging the people to serve the Most High.

<strong>Genuine Repentance—How Is It Identified?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span id="page696" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="696" data-before-text="696"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Another vital part of repentance is illustrated in the case of King Manasseh of Judah. Regarding his sin, the Bible tells us: “He did on a large scale what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, to offend him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977847/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:6</a>) Finally, as an expression of Jehovah’s judgment, Manasseh was taken captive to Babylon. There he repented. The Scriptures report: “He softened the face of Jehovah his God and kept humbling himself greatly because of the God of his forefathers. And he kept praying to Him, so that He let himself be entreated by him and He heard his request for favor and restored him to Jerusalem to his kingship.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977847/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:12, 13</a>) Thereafter Manasseh did what he could to rectify his wrongs, clearing out idolatrous practices from his realm, sacrificing to Jehovah and encouraging the people to serve the Most High. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977847/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:15, 16</a>) This shows that true repentance involves both abandoning the wrong course and making a determined effort to do what is right.</p>

The Scriptural record concerning his sins reads: “He went on to build altars to all the army of the heavens in two courtyards of the house of Jehovah. And he made his own son pass through the fire, and he practiced magic and looked for omens and made spirit mediums and professional foretellers of events. He did on a large scale what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, to offend him. And there was also innocent blood that Manasseh shed in very great quantity, until he had filled Jerusalem from end to end.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972523/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:5, 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972523/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Finally, when Manasseh found himself a captive in Babylon, he repented and kept praying to Jehovah. Despite Manasseh’s former conduct, Jehovah “heard his request for favor and restored him to Jerusalem to his kingship.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972523/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:11-13</a>) Few persons have acted as wickedly as did King Manasseh and, yet, on the basis of his repentance, he became a recipient of Jehovah’s mercy.</p>

In King Hezekiah’s reformation work, he held an extended celebration of the Festival of the Unfermented Cakes, and on this occasion Hezekiah instructed the people to fulfill their duty with respect to the contribution of firstfruits and tithes. Cheerfully the people responded by bringing in great quantities of the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil and honey and all the produce of the field, from the third month to the seventh.

It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p>

If the forty-year period had begun during the reign of his grandfather, King Manasseh, especially from the time that King Manasseh was taken captive to Babylon by the king of Assyria, then the forty years might have ended during the reign of King Josiah. How so? Because the reign of King Manasseh lasted for fifty-five years, and his son Amon’s reign lasted for two years, and that of King Josiah for thirty-one years.
