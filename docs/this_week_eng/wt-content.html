<br/>What we learn from the way a case of serious wrongdoing was handled in a congregation in first-century Corinth.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/> <strong>1.</strong><strong> What does Jehovah want for all people?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JEHOVAH created humans with free will. You use that gift regularly when you make decisions. The most important decision that any person can make is the decision to dedicate himself to Jehovah and to become part of His family of worshippers. Jehovah desires everyone to do so. Why? Because he loves people and wants the best for them. He wants them to enjoy a friendship with him and to live forever.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024532/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 30:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024532/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:7, 8</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> However, Jehovah does not force anyone to serve him. He allows each individual to decide what he will do. What if a baptized Christian breaks God’s law, committing a serious sin? If he does not repent, he must be removed from the congregation.

A brother in that congregation was having sexual relations with his stepmother. Such behavior was shocking and was “not even found among the nations”! The congregation not only tolerated his behavior but also may have been rather proud of it. Perhaps some thought that it demonstrated how merciful and understanding God is toward imperfect humans. But Jehovah does not condone wrongdoing among his people. With such a brazen course, the man was surely damaging the good reputation of the congregation. He could also have been influencing other Christians who were associating with him. So, what did Paul direct the congregation to do?<br/>&nbsp;

Paul explained that this command included “not even eating with such a man.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024532/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:11</a>) Sitting down to a meal with someone can easily lead to having further association with him. Clearly, then, Paul meant that the congregation should not socialize with that man.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> After sending his letter to the Christians in Corinth, Paul began to wonder how the congregation would react to it. Eventually, Titus brought news that delighted him. The congregation had responded well to Paul’s letter.

Furthermore, during the months that passed since Paul sent the letter, the wrongdoer had repented of his sinful course! He had changed his conduct and attitude and had begun to follow Jehovah’s righteous standards.

<br/> <strong>8.</strong><strong> What did Paul next tell the congregation to do?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Paul therefore directed the congregation: “Kindly forgive and comfort” the erring brother, and “confirm your love for him.” Note that Paul wanted the congregation to do more than merely allow the man back among Jehovah’s people. Paul wanted them to assure the repentant man by their words, manner, and actions that they truly forgave him and loved him. They would thus make it clear that they welcomed his return to the congregation.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/> <strong>9.</strong><strong> Why might some have been hesitant to forgive the repentant wrongdoer?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Did some in that congregation feel reluctant to welcome the repentant sinner back into their midst? The account does not tell us, but it is possible. After all, his actions brought trouble to the congregation as a whole and perhaps shame to certain individuals as well. Some might have felt that it was unfair that the man should be so warmly accepted as a brother when they were the ones who had fought so hard to remain morally clean. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024532/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 15:28-30</a>.) Why, though, was it important for the congregation to show genuine love for their returning brother?<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[Luke 15:28-30]</strong> <span id="v42-15-28-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070146/25720" class="vl vx vp">28 </a>But he became angry and refused to go in.

</div>

<br/><strong>10-11.</strong><strong> What could happen if the elders refused to forgive the repentant sinner?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Imagine what could happen if the elders refused to allow the truly repentant man back into the congregation or if after his return, the congregation refused to show him love. He could be swallowed up by “excessive sadness.” He could easily feel that his situation was hopeless. He might even give up in his efforts to repair his relationship with God.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Even worse, if the other brothers and sisters in the congregation refused to forgive the repentant sinner, they would put their own relationship with Jehovah in jeopardy. Why? Because they would reflect, not Jehovah’s forgiving attitude toward repentant wrongdoers, but Satan’s harsh and merciless attitude. They would, in effect, become tools that the Devil could use to destroy the man spiritually.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024532/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024532/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:27</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

</div>

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> To imitate Jehovah, the congregation in Corinth had to welcome the repentant man back and assure him of their love. By following Paul’s direction to welcome back the repentant sinner, the congregation showed their “obedience in all things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024532/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:9</a>) True, only months had passed since he was removed, but the discipline had successfully led him to repentance. So there would be no point in delaying his reinstatement into the congregation.

<br/><strong>16.</strong><strong> How do you feel about the way the case in Corinth was handled?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Our review of the way the case in Corinth was handled has helped us to see Jehovah’s love, righteousness, and justice in action. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024532/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 33:5</a>) Are you not moved to give our God added praise? After all, we are sinners​—every one of us—​and we need his forgiveness. Each of us has reason to be grateful to Jehovah for the ransom, which makes forgiveness possible. How comforting, how reassuring, to know that Jehovah truly loves his people and wants the best for them!<br/>&nbsp;
