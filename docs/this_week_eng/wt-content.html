<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Each week, we have opportunities to comment at our meetings. For example, on the weekends, we can participate during the congregation <em>Watchtower</em> Study. At our midweek meetings, we may comment during the Spiritual Gems, the Congregation Bible Study, and other discussion parts.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> We all want to praise Jehovah and encourage our fellow worshippers. But when commenting, we may face challenges. We may feel anxious about commenting, or we may keenly desire to participate but are not called on as often as we would like. How can we deal with these challenges? We find a key to the answer in the apostle Paul’s letter to the Hebrews. When discussing the importance of meeting together, he said that we should focus on “encouraging one another.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023365/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 10:24, 25</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> When we realize that others in the audience can be encouraged by even a simple expression of our faith, we <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>will feel better about volunteering to comment. And if we are not called on often, we can be happy that others in the congregation will have the opportunity to comment.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023365/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:8</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong><strong> What three points will be discussed in this article?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> In this article, we will first discuss how we can encourage one another in a <strong><em>small congregation</em></strong> where the number of commenters is limited. Then, we will examine how to encourage one another in a <strong><em>large congregation</em></strong> where many raise their hand to comment. Finally, we will discuss ways that we can make the <strong><em>content</em></strong> of our comments genuinely encouraging to others.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER IN A SMALL CONGREGATION</strong></h2><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong><strong> How can we encourage one another if few are in attendance?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In a small congregation or group, there are not as many commenters for the conductor to choose from. At times, he may need to wait awhile before someone volunteers to comment. The meeting may seem to drag on​—which is hardly encouraging. What can you do? Be willing to raise your hand frequently. By doing so, you may motivate others to participate more often.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>6-7.</strong><strong> How might we reduce any anxiety we have about commenting?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> What if the very thought of commenting makes you nervous? Many can relate to that feeling. Yet, in order to be of greater encouragement to your brothers and sisters, why not explore ways to reduce your anxiety about commenting? How might you do that?</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> You may find it helpful to review some of the suggestions published in previous issues of <em>The Watchtower.</em><a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023365/1">b</a> For example, prepare well. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023365/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5</a>) The more familiar you are with the material, the more at ease you will feel about volunteering to comment. Also, make your comments brief. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023365/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 15:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023365/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 17:27</a>) A short answer gives you less to worry about. A brief comment, perhaps consisting of just one or two sentences, may even be easier for your brothers and sisters to understand than a lengthy comment that develops many ideas. By making a brief comment in your own words, you will show that you have prepared well and that you have a clear understanding of the material.</p><br/>&nbsp;

If so, you might be tempted to give up and just listen to the meeting. But do not stop trying to comment. What can you do? You may find it helpful to prepare several comments for each meeting. Then if you are not chosen to comment early in the study, you will still have opportunities to comment as the meeting progresses. When preparing for the <em>Watchtower</em> Study, think about how each paragraph ties in to the theme of the article. If you do, you will likely have something to offer throughout the lesson. Additionally, you might prepare to comment on paragraphs that discuss deeper truths that are more difficult to explain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023365/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:10</a>) Why? Because there may be fewer volunteers during that part of the lesson.

This may mean commenting a little more often. Or it may mean being content with the opportunities we have to comment and being glad that others appreciate the privilege as much as we do. By focusing on the interests of others at congregation meetings, we can all enjoy “an interchange of encouragement.”​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023365/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 1:11, 12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
