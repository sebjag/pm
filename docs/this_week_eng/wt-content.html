<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We may need to change what we pray for as we discern Jehovah’s will more clearly. Consider the example of Martin Poetzinger. Soon after getting married, Brother Poetzinger was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. At first, he asked Jehovah to let him out of the concentration camp so that he could care for his wife and resume his preaching work. However, after two weeks, he saw no indication that Jehovah was opening the way for him to leave. So he began praying: “Jehovah, please show me what you want me to do.” He then began to think about what the other brothers in the camp were going through. Many of them were very worried about their own wife and children. Brother Poetzinger then prayed: “Jehovah, thank you for my new assignment. Help me to strengthen and encourage my <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>brothers.” He spent the next nine years in the camps doing exactly that!</p><br/>&nbsp;

Her son suffers from several mental health problems. When he was involved in a terrible accident, she and her husband resigned from their work to care for him. As a result, they had financial problems. Soo Hing said that she felt like a rubber band that was stretched to the limit. She poured out her heart to Jehovah, asking him for help. The consulting doctor took an interest in their case. This led to their receiving government assistance and an affordable place to live. Afterward, Soo Hing said: “We saw Jehovah’s hand in this matter. He truly is the ‘Hearer of prayer.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023401/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Our prayers are not usually answered in spectacular ways. But the answers we do receive are just what we need to remain loyal to our heavenly Father. So be on the lookout for Jehovah’s answers to your prayers. A sister named Yoko felt that Jehovah was not answering her prayers, but then she began to keep a record of what she asked Jehovah for. After some time had gone by, she looked back through her notebook and realized that Jehovah had answered most of her prayers, even some that she had forgotten about. From time to time, we need to pause and reflect on how Jehovah is answering our prayers.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023401/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 66:19, 20</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

They continued to do all they could, serving as regular pioneers where the need was greater and supporting theocratic construction projects. Today they are in the traveling work. “Jehovah has not always answered our prayers in the way that we expected,” says Mike, “but he <strong><em>has</em></strong> answered them and in ways that were even better than we could have imagined.”</p><br/>&nbsp;
