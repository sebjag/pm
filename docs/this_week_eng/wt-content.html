<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>GOD’S WORD often describes faithful men as powerful. But even the strongest among them did not always <strong><em>feel</em></strong> strong. For example, on some occasions King David felt that he was “as strong as a mountain,” but on other occasions he “became terrified.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 30:7</a>) Although Samson was exceptionally powerful when he was moved by God’s spirit, he recognized that without the power that comes from God, he would “grow weak and become like all other men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 14:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16:17</a>) These faithful men were strong only because Jehovah gave them power.</p><br/>&nbsp;

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:10</a>) But we cannot expect to receive that power without making any effort on our part. To illustrate, an engine can power a car to move forward. However, a driver must press the accelerator in order to go anywhere. Similarly, <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>Jehovah is ready to give us the power we need, but we must take steps to benefit from it. What has Jehovah provided to make us strong? And what do we need to do in order to receive that power? We will learn the answers to those questions by considering how Jehovah strengthened three Bible characters​—the prophet Jonah, Mary the mother of Jesus, and the apostle Paul. We will also see how Jehovah continues to strengthen his servants today in similar ways.</p><br/>&nbsp;

He had run away from a challenging assignment that Jehovah had given him. As a result, he almost lost his life in a violent storm and he put the lives of his shipmates in jeopardy. When he was thrown overboard, he found himself in a place he had never been before​—the dark belly of a great fish. How do you think Jonah felt? Did he expect to die there? Might he have wondered whether Jehovah had rejected him? Jonah must have felt very anxious.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Jonah also reflected on the Scriptures. Why can we say that? His prayer, recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jonah chapter 2</a>, uses many of the same words and phrases that are found in the Psalms. (For example, compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jonah 2:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 5</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 69:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 86:7</a>.) It is clear that Jonah knew those passages well. And by reflecting on them during his ordeal, he felt reassured that Jehovah would help him. Later, Jonah was returned to dry land, and he was ready to accept and fulfill his next assignment.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023602/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jonah 2:10–3:4</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Jonah’s example can help us when we are going through various trials. For example, Zhiming,<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023602/1">b</a> a brother in Taiwan, suffers from serious health problems. In addition, he has to endure violent family opposition because of his faith in Jehovah. He gets strength from Jehovah through prayer and study. “Sometimes, when problems arise,” he admits, “I feel so anxious that I can’t calm down enough to do my personal study.” But he does not give up. “First, I pray to <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>Jehovah,” he says. “Next, I put on my earphones and listen to our Kingdom songs. At times, I even sing them in a low voice until I calm down. Then I begin studying.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Personal study has strengthened Zhiming in unexpected ways. For example, while he was recovering from a major operation, a nurse told him that because of his low red blood cell count, he would need a blood transfusion. The night before his operation, Zhiming read about a sister who had the same operation. Her red blood cell count had dropped even lower than his; yet, she did not accept a blood transfusion and was able to recover. That experience strengthened Zhiming to remain faithful.</p><br/>&nbsp;
