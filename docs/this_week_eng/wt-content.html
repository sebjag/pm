<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Why did Paul write his letter to the Hebrew Christians in Judea?

Their former religious leaders may <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>have ridiculed them for becoming Christians. Why? Because Christians had no impressive temple to go to for worship, no physical altar on which to make sacrifices to God, and no priests to minister to them. This could have discouraged Christ’s disciples and caused their faith to weaken.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Paul explained to his Hebrew brothers why their Christian worship was far superior to the worship they offered in the past. The features of the Jewish religion were only “a <strong><em>shadow</em></strong> of the things to come, but the <strong><em>reality</em></strong> belongs to the Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023606/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 2:17</a>) The shadow that an object casts is only a general shape of the real thing that casts the shadow. So, too, the ancient Jewish pattern of worship was just a shadow of the reality that was to come. We need to understand the arrangement Jehovah has put in place for us to have our sins forgiven so that we can offer acceptable worship. Let us compare the “shadow” (the ancient Jewish pattern) with “the reality” (the Christian way of worship), as explained in Hebrews. By doing so, we can better understand the spiritual temple and how it involves us.</p><br/>&nbsp;
