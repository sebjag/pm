<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[46]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The Memorial helps us to reflect on the value of the ransom.

Some are even moved to return to Jehovah because of the warm welcome they receive. And many interested people are motivated to start on the road to life by what they see and hear. No wonder the Memorial holds such a special place in our heart!</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[70]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Never underestimate the power of a personal invitation. One day, a sister who lived in a religiously divided household was surprised when her husband proudly told her that he was planning to join her for the Memorial. Why was she surprised? Because many times in the past, she had encouraged him to attend, but he never did. What made the difference this time? “I got a personal invitation,” he said, explaining that a local elder with whom he was acquainted had invited him. The husband attended that year and for many years thereafter.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[80]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Is it any wonder that Jesus arranged for us to observe the Memorial of his death each year? When we do, we benefit ourselves and others in many ways. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024241/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isa. 48:17, 18</a>) We grow in our love for Jehovah and Jesus. We show how much we appreciate what they have done for us. We strengthen our bonds with our fellow believers. And we may help others learn how they too can enjoy the blessings that the ransom makes possible. Let us do all we can, then, to be ready for this year’s Memorial​—the most important day of the year!</p>
