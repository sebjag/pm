<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Love was the identifying mark of the early Christians. But did they find it easy to show love? Consider the diversity of the congregation in Rome. Among them were not only Jews, who were raised to obey the Mosaic Law, but also Gentiles, whose background was totally different. Some Christians were likely slaves while others were freemen​—perhaps some were even slave owners. How could those Christians overcome such differences and strengthen their love? The apostle Paul urged them to “welcome one another.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023480/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 15:7</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> What did he mean? The word translated “welcome” means to receive someone kindly or hospitably, such as into one’s home or circle of friends. For example, Paul told Philemon how to welcome the runaway slave Onesimus: “Receive him kindly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023480/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Philem. 17</a>) And Priscilla and Aquila welcomed Apollos, who knew less about Christianity than they did, by taking “him into their company.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023480/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 18:26</a>) Rather than allow their diversity to divide them, those Christians overcame their differences and welcomed one another.</p><br/>&nbsp;

I now love the variety. Jehovah obviously loves it too because he has drawn us into such a diverse group.” When we learn to see others as Jehovah sees them, we prove that we love them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023480/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:24</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Love will be vital during the great tribulation. When that tribulation begins, where will we find protection? Consider what Jehovah instructed his people to do when ancient Babylon was attacked: “Go, my people, enter your inner rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for a brief moment until the wrath has passed by.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023480/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isa. 26:20</a>) It seems that those words also apply to us who will face the great tribulation. The “inner rooms” may refer to our congregations. During the great tribulation, we will find the protection that Jehovah promises as we remain united with fellow believers. Therefore, we must work hard now not just to tolerate our brothers and sisters but also to love them. Our survival may depend on it!</p><br/>&nbsp;
