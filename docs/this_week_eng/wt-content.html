For example, Jehovah’s humility was evident when he was about to destroy the wicked people of Sodom. Through his angels, Jehovah instructed righteous Lot to flee to the mountainous region. Lot was afraid to go there. So he pleaded that he and his family be allowed to take refuge in Zoar, a small town that was slated for destruction. Jehovah could have insisted that Lot follow His instructions to the letter. Instead, he granted Lot’s request, even though it meant sparing Zoar.

He sent the prophet Jonah to announce the imminent destruction of the city and its wicked inhabitants.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jesus imitated Jehovah’s reasonableness. He was sent to earth to preach to “the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But he showed reasonableness in carrying out that assignment. On one occasion, a non-Israelite woman begged him to heal her daughter who was “cruelly demon possessed.” Jesus compassionately did as the woman asked and healed her daughter.

No. Jesus took into account Peter’s repentance and faith.

Just as they began to learn the language and settle into their new congregation, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and they had to isolate themselves physically. Then Francesca’s mother died suddenly. Francesca desperately wanted to be with her family, but the pandemic prevented her from traveling there. How was she able to cope with these discouraging developments? First, Emanuele and Francesca as a couple prayed for the wisdom to take one day at a time. Jehovah answered their prayers through timely spiritual provisions. For example, they were encouraged by one brother who said in a video interview: “The quicker we accept the new circumstances, the quicker our joy returns to us along with the opportunity to make good use of the new circumstances.”<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023486/2">c</a> Second, they were motivated to become more skillful at telephone witnessing and they even started a Bible study. Third, they gratefully accepted the loving encouragement and support of the local brothers. One thoughtful sister sent them a short Scriptural message every day for a year. When we likewise accept our new circumstances, we will find satisfaction in what we are able to do.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Dress and grooming.</em></strong> Instead of strictly regulating the way we dress, Jehovah has given us principles to follow. We are to dress in a way that is appropriate for ministers of God, showing reasonableness, modesty, and “soundness of mind.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023486/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023486/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:3</a>) Therefore, we do not draw undue attention to ourselves by how we dress. Bible principles will also help elders to avoid setting arbitrary rules about clothing and hairstyles. For example, elders in one congregation wanted to help some young brothers who had adopted a popular hairstyle that was short but completely unkempt. How could the elders help them without making a rule? The circuit overseer advised the elders to tell the brothers, “If you are on the platform and the audience is paying more attention to how you look than to what you are saying, there is a problem with your dress and grooming.” This simple explanation resolved the issue without the need to make a rule.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023486/3">d</a></p><br/>&nbsp;

No matter how strongly we feel about a form of treatment, we need to respect the right of our brothers and sisters to make their own health-care decisions. In this regard, we should keep the following points in mind: (1) Only God’s Kingdom will bring complete and permanent healing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023486/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 33:24</a>) (2) Each Christian must be “fully convinced” of what is best for him. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023486/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 14:5</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> (3) We do not judge others or put a stumbling block before them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023486/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rom. 14:13</a>) (4) Christians show love and do not put their freedom to make personal choices ahead of the unity of the congregation.
