<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>DO YOU at times worry about the future? Perhaps you have lost your job and you worry about providing for your family. You may be concerned about your family’s safety because of unstable political conditions, persecution, or opposition to the preaching work. Are you facing any of these issues? If so, you will benefit from considering how Jehovah helped the ancient Israelites when they were confronted with similar problems.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> It took faith on the part of the Jews who had lived in Babylon all their lives to leave behind a comfortable lifestyle and travel to a country that most of them knew very little about. When they arrived, it was not long before they were affected by unstable economic and political conditions as well as opposition. Some therefore found it hard to focus on rebuilding Jehovah’s temple. Thus, about 520 B.C.E., Jehovah commissioned two prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, to rekindle the people’s zeal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023646/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023646/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Zech. 1:1</a>) As we will see, the encouragement given by these prophets proved to be very effective. Nearly 50 years later, however, the returning Jews again reached a low point. Ezra, a skilled copyist of the Law, then came from Babylon to Jerusalem to encourage God’s people to give priority to true worship.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023646/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023646/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>

Their land was now part of the Persian Empire. After Persian King Cyrus died in 530 B.C.E., his successor, Cambyses, embarked on a military campaign to conquer Egypt. While heading for Egypt, his soldiers likely demanded food, water, and shelter from the Israelites, which caused them further hardship. The early reign of Cambyses’ successor, Darius I, was marked by revolts and political instability. These conditions no doubt caused many of the returned exiles to worry about how they would provide for their family. Because of all the uncertainty they faced, some Jews felt that it was not the right time to rebuild Jehovah’s temple.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023646/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hag. 1:2</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
