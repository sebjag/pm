<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[61]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> You would also do well to examine yourself honestly regarding your weaknesses. A brother named Robert relates an experience that illustrates the point: “When I was about 20 years old, I had a part-time job. One day after work, a coworker invited me to her home. She said we’d be alone and we’d ‘have a good time.’ At first, I gave a few weak excuses, but I finally said no and explained why.” Robert resisted the temptation, and that is commendable. Later, though, he looked back on the incident and saw that he could have handled the situation better. He admits: “I didn’t reject <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>the offer as firmly or as quickly as Joseph resisted Potiphar’s wife. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024321/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Gen. 39:7-9</a>) In fact, I was surprised at how difficult it was for me to refuse.
