Many of these, like the first-century disciple Timothy, were taught the truth “from infancy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024320/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:14, 15</a>) Others learned about Jehovah as adults, some late in life.

That is a commendable goal! Before getting baptized, though, you will need to dedicate yourself to Jehovah. This article will explain what dedication involves.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> In the Bible, dedication signifies a setting apart for a sacred purpose. The Israelites were a nation dedicated to Jehovah. But some individuals in the nation were dedicated to Jehovah in a special way. For example, Aaron wore a “holy sign of dedication”​—a shining gold plate on the front of his turban. That gold plate indicated that he was set apart to serve in a special capacity​—as Israel’s high priest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024320/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 8:9</a>) The Nazirites <span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>too were dedicated to Jehovah in a special way. The word “Nazirite,” which comes from the Hebrew word <em>nazirʹ,</em> means “Separated One,” or “Dedicated One.” Nazirites were to live by the restrictions that were set out for them in the Mosaic Law.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024320/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Num. 6:2-8</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

What will Christian dedication require of you? Jesus said: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024320/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 16:24</a>) The Greek phrase translated “let him disown himself” can also be rendered “he must say no to himself.” As a dedicated servant of Jehovah, you will need to say no to anything that conflicts with his will. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024320/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>) That includes saying no to “the works of the flesh,” such as sexual immorality.

In the case of young ones who have no Christian parents, the elders in the congregation will lovingly help them to count the cost of discipleship. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 14:27-30</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Just as it takes planning to complete a building project successfully, so it requires preparation to serve Jehovah faithfully “to the end.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 24:13</a>) But what can young ones themselves do to become determined to serve Jehovah for the rest of their life?

If so, you are to be commended! It is a great privilege to get baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Moreover, baptism is a requirement for Christians, and it is a vital step toward gaining salvation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:21</a>) Because it is your heartfelt desire to keep the promise you will make to Jehovah, you want to be prepared for this important step. You do well, therefore, to consider three questions that may help you to see if you are ready for baptism. The questions are as follows: (1) Am I mature enough to make the decision? (2) Do I have a personal desire to do so? (3) Do I understand what it means to be dedicated to Jehovah? Let us examine those questions.</p><h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>WHEN YOU ARE MATURE ENOUGH</strong></h2>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"><strong>4, 5.</strong><strong> (a) Why is baptism not for older people only? (b) What does it mean for a Christian to be mature?</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The Bible does not suggest that baptism is a step to be taken only by those who are older or who have reached at least an age at which certain legal rights <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>may be granted. We read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:11</a>: “Even a child is known by his actions, whether his behavior is pure and right.” One who is somewhat younger can realize what it means to do what is right and to be dedicated to his Creator. Thus, baptism is an important and appropriate step for a young person who has manifested considerable maturity and has made a dedication to Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 20:7</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> What does it mean to be mature? Maturity involves more than physical growth. The Bible says that mature people “have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) Thus, mature people know what is right in Jehovah’s eyes and <em>are resolved in their heart to stick to it.</em> As a result, they are not easily swayed to do what is wrong; nor do they always have to be prodded to do what is right. Really, it is only reasonable to expect that a young person who gets baptized will uphold God’s standards even when parents or other adults are not present.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Philippians 2:12</a>.</p>

Well, consider the Bible example of Daniel. He may have been in his early teens when he was forcibly taken from his parents into exile in Babylon. Suddenly, Daniel found himself living among a people who had a completely different concept of right and wrong. In addition, there was another challenge to Daniel’s situation: He was treated as someone special in Babylon. In fact, Daniel was one of a number of young people carefully chosen to stand before the king!

How could you measure the strength of your resolve? Ask yourself, ‘What is my track record of adhering to God’s standards?’ Give thought to the way you have reacted to recent tests of faith. Have you demonstrated that you have the discernment needed to distinguish right from wrong? What if, like Daniel, you are treated as special by <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>someone in Satan’s world?

They are meant to help you put baptism in the right perspective. As mentioned earlier, baptism symbolizes that you made a solemn promise to Jehovah himself. You promise that you will love him and serve him forever with your whole heart. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>) Everyone who gets baptized should be determined to follow through on his promise.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Ecclesiastes 5:4, 5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>IS IT YOUR PERSONAL DESIRE?</strong></h2>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>11, 12.</strong><strong> (a) A person who is thinking about getting baptized needs to be sure of what? (b) What will help you to keep the right view of Jehovah’s arrangement of baptism?</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> The Bible says that Jehovah’s people, including young ones, “will offer themselves willingly” for his service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) So a person who is contemplating baptism needs to be sure that this is his or her <em>personal</em> desire. That might call for self-scrutiny on your part. Why? Because your circumstance as a youth may be somewhat special. For example, you may have been raised in the truth.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Over the years, you have likely seen many people get baptized​—including some of your peers and perhaps even your siblings. If that is indeed your situation, what should you be careful about? Be alert that you do not come to view baptism as little more than a coming-of-age custom that all young people follow sooner or later. What can you do to make sure that you will keep the right view of Jehovah’s arrangement of baptism? Take time often to stop and think about the reasons <em>why</em> getting baptized is so important. In fact, you can find several good reasons in this article and in the next.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong><strong> How can you tell whether the decision to get baptized comes from your heart?</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> There are ways in which you will be able to discern whether your decision to get baptized comes from your heart. For example, your heartfelt desire to serve Jehovah will be reflected in your prayers. How often you pray and how specific your prayers are may well reveal how close your relationship with Jehovah is. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 25:4</a>) An important way that Jehovah answers our prayers is by directing our attention to his Word. Thus, our effort to study the Bible is yet another indication that we really want to draw closer to Jehovah and serve him from the heart. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>) So ask yourself: ‘How specific are my prayers? How regular is my personal study of the Bible?’ And if your Christian family has a Family Worship evening, ask yourself: ‘Do I willingly share in that family arrangement?’ Your answers to these questions will help you to see whether your decision to get baptized is your personal desire.</p><h2 id="p24" data-pid="24"><strong>THE MEANING OF DEDICATION</strong></h2>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong><strong> Describe the difference between dedication and baptism.</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Some might be confused about the difference between dedication and baptism. For example, some young people say that they have made a dedication to Jehovah but are not ready to get baptized. Does that make sense? Making a dedication means telling Jehovah that you will serve him forever. At baptism, a <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>person shows others that he is dedicated. Therefore, baptism is a public expression of a private dedication that you have already made in prayer to Jehovah. Before you get baptized, you need to be sure that you understand what dedication means.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>15.</strong><strong> What does dedication mean?</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Simply stated, when you dedicate your life to Jehovah, you give up ownership of yourself. You promise Jehovah that you will put the doing of his will ahead of everything else in your life. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 16:24</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Any promise should be taken seriously, but how much more so a promise made to Jehovah God! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 5:33</a>) How, though, can you demonstrate that you have really disowned yourself and that you now belong to Jehovah?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rom. 14:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>16, 17.</strong><strong> (a) Illustrate what it means to disown yourself. (b) What is a person who makes a dedication really saying?</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> To illustrate, imagine that a friend gives you a car as a gift. He hands you the title and says: “The car is yours.” But suppose your friend adds: “I will keep the keys. And I will be the one who drives the car, not you.” How would you feel about this “gift”? How would you feel about the giver?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Now think about what Jehovah rightfully expects of a person who makes a dedication to him, a person who tells him: “I am giving you my life. I <em>belong</em> to you.” What if that person were to start living a double life, perhaps secretly dating an unbeliever? What if he were to accept employment that crippled his whole-souled service in the ministry or attendance at Christian meetings? Would that not be like keeping the keys to the car? A person who dedicates himself to Jehovah is, in effect, saying: “My life belongs to <em>you</em> more than to me. If there is ever a conflict between what you want and what I am inclined to want, what you want will win​—every time.” That would reflect the thinking of Jesus, who while on earth stated: “I have come down from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016201/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 6:38</a>.</p>

(b) How do you feel about the privilege of baptism?</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Clearly, baptism is a sobering step that neither you nor anyone else should take lightly. At the same time, it is a great privilege to be dedicated and baptized. Young ones who love Jehovah and who understand what dedication means do not hold back from getting baptized; nor do they at any time regret their decision. “I love Jehovah, and I couldn’t be happier doing anything but serving him,” says a baptized teenager named Rose. “I have never been more sure about anything in my life than my decision to get baptized.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> And what about Christopher, mentioned at the outset of this article? Did his decision to get baptized at age 12 prove to be well-founded? Christopher looks back on his dedication and baptism with fond appreciation. He began serving as a regular pioneer at age 17 and was appointed as a ministerial servant at 18. Today he is serving at Bethel. He says: “Baptism was the right decision. My life is filled with satisfying work for Jehovah and his organization.” If you are considering baptism, how can you prepare for it?

What convinces me that the Bible is God’s inspired Word? Why do I feel that living by God’s moral standards is better than adopting the lifestyle of the world? Those questions are not designed to create doubts in your mind. Rather, they can help you to follow the apostle Paul’s admonition: <em>“Prove to yourselves</em> the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) But why did Christians in Rome need to prove to themselves something that they had already accepted?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Consider a Bible example.

He accepted it, not because his mother and grandmother told him to do so, but because he had reasoned on it for himself and had been persuaded.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 12:1</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong><strong> Why is it reasonable to expect that a baptized Christian would have actions in line with his faith?</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> The Bible says: “Faith by itself, without works, is dead.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 2:17</a>) If you have strong conviction, it is reasonable to expect that you will show it by your actions.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) Can you think of specific occasions when you resisted temptation or peer pressure?

Your service to him should not depend on others​—not even your parents. Your holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion give evidence that you have made the truth your own and that you are progressing toward baptism.</p><h2 id="p25" data-pid="25"><strong>YOUR APPRECIATION</strong></h2>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>16, 17.</strong><strong> (a) What should motivate a person to become a Christian? (b) How can appreciation for the ransom be illustrated?</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> A man well-versed in the Mosaic Law asked Jesus: “Which is the greatest commandment?” Jesus answered: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 22:35-37</a>) Jesus there identified what should be the motive behind Christian works, including baptism​—wholehearted love for Jehovah. One of the best ways that you can grow in your love for Jehovah is to meditate on the greatest gift Jehovah has provided​—the ransom sacrifice of his Son. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 5:14, 15;</strong></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> <strong>1 John 4:9,</strong></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> <strong>19</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Thinking about the ransom and what it means for you will motivate you to respond appreciatively.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Your response to the ransom might be illustrated this way: Imagine that someone rescued you from drowning. Would you simply go home, dry yourself off, and forget about what was done for you? Of course not! You would certainly feel indebted to the person who rescued you. The fact is, you would owe that person your life! We owe Jehovah God and Jesus Christ much more. Without the ransom, each of us would, in a sense, drown in sin and death. But because of this great act of love, we now have the incomparable prospect of living forever on a paradise earth!</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>18, 19.</strong><strong> (a) Why should you not fear belonging to Jehovah? (b) How does serving Jehovah make your life better?</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Do you appreciate what Jehovah has done for you? Then it would be fitting to dedicate your life to Jehovah and get baptized. Remember, dedication involves a solemn promise to Jehovah to do his will forever, no matter what happens. Should you be afraid to make such a commitment? Not at all! Bear in mind that Jehovah has your best interests at heart, and he is “the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6</a>) Dedicating yourself to Jehovah and getting baptized do not make your life worse. On the contrary, serving Jehovah will make your life better. A 24-year-old brother who got baptized before he was a teenager says: “I may have had a deeper understanding if I had been older, but making the decision to dedicate myself to Jehovah protected me from worldly pursuits.”</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> How different Jehovah is from Satan, whose interest in you is only selfish! Satan offers no lasting reward to those who side with him. And really, how could he? Satan himself has no good news to contemplate, no bright hope on the horizon. How can he give you something that he does not possess? Satan can offer you nothing more than a dismal future, like the future that is ahead for him!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 20:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>20.</strong><strong> What can a young person do in order to progress toward dedication and baptism?

Are you ready to take that step? If so, do not hold back. On the other hand, if you need more time, use the suggestions in this article to keep moving forward. Paul wrote to the Philippians: “To the extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same course.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016202/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16</a>) If you follow that advice, you will soon want to dedicate your life to Jehovah and get baptized.</p>

They may wonder, ‘What if afterward I commit a serious sin and get disfellowshipped?’ If you have that fear, be assured that Jehovah will give you everything you need “to walk worthily of [him] in order to please him fully.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024320/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Col. 1:10</a>) He will also give you the strength to do what is right. He has already proved that he can do that by how he has dealt with many others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024320/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>) That is one reason why relatively few people are expelled from the Christian congregation.

To that end, pray every day. Maintain a good routine of personal study of God’s Word. Attend Christian meetings. Share your faith with others.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[61]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> You will find it easier to live up to your dedication if you decide <strong><em>beforehand</em></strong> what you will do if faced with temptation. The Bible tells us of a number of people who evidently did that, even though they too were imperfect humans. For example, Potiphar’s wife repeatedly tried to seduce Joseph. But he did not have any doubts about the stand he would take. The Bible tells us that “he refused,” and he stated: “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024320/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 39:8-10</a>) Clearly, Joseph knew how he would react even <strong><em>before</em></strong> she tried to tempt him. That made it easier for him when he was actually faced with temptation.</p><br/>&nbsp;
