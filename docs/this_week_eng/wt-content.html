Consider how the father of a sister named Katya helped her to make good decisions. Each day as her father took her to school, he would discuss the daily text with her. “Those discussions,” she says, “helped me to handle difficult situations that came up during the day.” What, though, if the Bible-based direction your parents give you seems to restrict your freedom? What can help you to accept their guidance? A sister named Anastasia recalls that her parents took the time to explain why they made certain rules. She states, “That helped me to accept the limitations, not as mere restrictions, but as loving protection.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

Regarding your choice of friends, ask yourself: ‘Do they help me to strengthen my faith in Jehovah? Are they encouraging me to live by God’s standards?

However, many people use this form of communication to impress others, posting photos and videos of what they have bought or done. If you use social media, ask yourself: ‘Is my motive to impress others? Is my goal to build others up, or is it to boost my image? Am I allowing the people who use this tool to influence my thinking, speech, and actions in a negative way?’ Brother Nathan Knorr, who served as a member of the Governing Body, gave this advice: “Don’t try to please men. You will wind up pleasing no one. Please Jehovah, and you will please all those who love Jehovah.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

For example, a history lesson may call to my mind a Bible account or a prophecy. Or a conversation may remind me of a useful scripture I can share with someone.” The challenges you face may differ from those King Josiah faced, but you can be wise and loyal, as he was.

The record of Jehoash, Uzziah, and Josiah illustrates that young ones can make wise choices and follow a course that pleases Jehovah. True, a good outcome is not guaranteed, as we noted. Nonetheless, we can imitate the good that these kings did and avoid making the mistakes they made. Then we can look forward to a good outcome.</p><br/>&nbsp;
