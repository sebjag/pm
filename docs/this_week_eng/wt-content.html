And that inspired counsel can help us too. As noted, it can aid us in choosing our entertainment and our associates wisely. It can motivate us to continue immersing ourselves in the light of truth by having a consistent program of Bible study. And it emphasizes the importance of holy spirit, which can produce fine qualities in us. Applying what Paul wrote can help us to make wise decisions, ones that are in harmony with Jehovah’s thinking. By doing these things, we will be able to avoid the darkness of this world and remain in the light!</p>
