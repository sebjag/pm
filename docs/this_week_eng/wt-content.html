<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong><strong> Illustrate why we should follow Jehovah as our Guide.</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IMAGINE that you are lost in a forest. Danger lurks around you: wild animals, disease-carrying insects, poisonous plants, and rocky terrain. How grateful you would be for an experienced guide who knows where the danger is and how to steer you away from it! This world is like that forest. It is filled with danger that especially threatens our spiritual health. But we have a perfect Guide​—Jehovah. He leads us away from the danger and toward our destination​—everlasting life in the new world.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong><strong> How does Jehovah guide us?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> How does Jehovah guide us? Primarily, by means of his written Word, the Bible. However, he also uses human representatives. For example, he uses “the faithful and discreet slave” to provide spiritual food that helps us make wise decisions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024285/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) Jehovah also uses other capable men to guide us. For example, circuit overseers and congregation elders provide encouragement and instruction that can help us get through difficult times. How grateful we are for reliable guidance during these critical last days! It helps us maintain Jehovah’s approval and keeps us on the road to life.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Or we might feel that the direction we receive is unwise and conclude that the counsel <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>must not be from Jehovah. At such times, we especially need confidence that Jehovah is the one leading his people and that following his guidance results in blessings. To help strengthen our confidence, this article will consider (1) how Jehovah guided his people in Bible times, (2) how he is guiding us today, and (3) how we benefit when we keep following his guidance.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Consider, for example, certain developments that took place in the late 1800’s.

Was Jehovah guiding their Bible research? He clearly was. In 1914 world events confirmed that God’s Kingdom had begun to rule. World War I broke out, followed by pestilences, earthquakes, and food shortages.

So even though the move may have seemed impractical at the time, the Watchtower Bible College (School) of Gilead was established by Jehovah’s organization to train missionaries to preach and teach in lands throughout the earth. Missionaries were sent out even during the war. Additionally, the faithful slave arranged for the Course in Theocratic Ministry<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024285/1">b</a> to train all in the congregations to become better preachers and teachers.

As a result, they were able to volunteer to work on theocratic construction projects. Robyn says: “We have lived in some very small spaces, often with no kitchen. And I had to sell a lot of equipment that I used for photography, a hobby I loved. That brought me to tears. But like Abraham’s wife, Sarah, I was determined to look ahead, not back.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024285/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 11:15</a>) What did this couple gain from their experience? Robyn says: “We have the deep satisfaction of knowing that we are giving Jehovah everything we have. When working on theocratic assignments, we get a glimpse of how life will be in the new world.” Andy agrees, saying: “We have the satisfaction of being completely spent in support of the Kingdom.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[study note on Matthew 6:22]</strong> <br/><strong>lamp of the body is the eye:</strong> A literal eye that functions properly is to the body like a lighted lamp in a dark place. It enlightens the entire person. Here “eye” is used in a figurative sense.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070606/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Eph 1:18</a>.<br/><strong>focused:</strong> Or “clear; healthy.” The basic meaning of the Greek word <em>ha·plousʹ</em> is “single; simple.” It can convey the idea of singleness of mind or devotion to one purpose. For a literal eye to function properly, it must be able to focus on one thing. A person whose figurative eye is “focused” on the one right thing (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070606/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Mt 6:33</a>) will experience a positive effect on his whole personality.
