<br/>How to cope with injustice in a way that avoids making matters worse.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> How might injustice affect all of us in one way or another?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JESUS told an illustration about a widow who kept asking a judge to give her justice. No doubt that story resonated with many of Jesus’ disciples because in his day the common people were often victims of injustice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 18:1-5</a>) The story is also meaningful to us today because we have all experienced injustice at one time or another.<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[Luke 18:1-5]</strong> <span id="v42-18-1-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070146/25793" class="cl vx vp study"><strong>18</strong> </a>Then he went on to tell them an illustration about the need for them always to pray and not to give up,<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070146/692" data-bid="693-1" class="b">+</a> </span><span id="v42-18-2-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070146/25794" class="vl vx vp study">2 </a>saying: “In a certain city there was a judge who had no fear of God and no respect for man. </span><span id="v42-18-3-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070146/25795" class="vl vx vp">3 </a>There was also a widow in that city who kept going to him and saying, ‘See that I get justice from my legal opponent.’ </span><span id="v42-18-4-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070146/25796" class="vl vx vp study">4 </a>Well, for a while he was unwilling, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Although I do not fear God or respect any man, </span><span id="v42-18-5-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070146/25797" class="vl vx vp study">5 </a>because this widow keeps making me trouble, I will see that she gets justice so that she will not keep coming and wearing me out with her demand.’”<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070146/693" data-bid="694-1" class="b">+</a> </span>
</div>

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> In the world today, prejudice, inequality, and oppression are common, so we are not surprised when we are treated unfairly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:8</a>) What we might not expect, though, is to be misjudged by a brother or a sister; yet, that can happen. Of course, our brothers and sisters are not opposers of the truth. They are simply imperfect. We can learn much from how Jesus reacted to injustices from wicked opposers. If we can be patient with opposers who treat us unjustly, how much more so should we be patient with our fellow believers! How does Jehovah feel when we are treated unjustly either by those outside the congregation or by those inside the congregation? Does he care?<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[Eccl. 5:8]</strong> <span id="v21-5-8-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070125/17521" class="vl vx vp">8 </a>If you see any oppression of the poor and a violation of justice and righteousness in your district, do not be surprised about the matter.<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070125/107" data-bid="108-1" class="b">+</a> For that high official is being watched by one who is higher than he is, and there are others who are still higher than they are.</span>

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Jehovah cares deeply about the way we are treated. “Jehovah loves justice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 37:28</a>) Jesus assures us that Jehovah will “cause justice to be done . . . speedily” <span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>when the time is right. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 18:7, 8</a>) And soon he will undo all the harm we have suffered and eliminate all forms of injustice.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 72:1, 2</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>4.</strong><strong> What help does Jehovah provide for us today?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> While we await the time when righteousness will prevail, Jehovah helps us to cope with injustice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>) He teaches us how to avoid doing something unwise when we are treated unfairly. Through his Son, Jehovah provides us with the perfect example of the way we can deal with injustice. And he gives us practical counsel that we can apply when we are treated unjustly.

<br/> <strong>5.</strong><strong> Why should we be careful about the way we react to injustice?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> We may feel deeply hurt and distressed by injustice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:7</a>) Faithful servants, such as Job and Habakkuk, felt the same way.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> We could react to an injustice by improperly trying to take matters into our own hands. Responding in that way, however, could make matters much worse. Consider the example of King David’s son Absalom. He was outraged when his sister Tamar was raped by their half brother Amnon. According to the Mosaic Law, Amnon deserved to die for what he had done. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lev. 20:17</a>) Although Absalom’s anger was certainly understandable, he was not authorized to take matters into his own hands.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Sam. 13:20-23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 28, 29</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> When those who act unjustly seem to go unpunished, we might question whether it is worthwhile to do what is right.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 73:12</a>) He was also so distraught about the injustice he saw that he almost lost confidence in <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>the benefits of serving Jehovah, saying: “When I tried to understand it, it was troubling to me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 73:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 16</a>) In fact, he revealed: “As for me, my feet had almost strayed; my steps had nearly slipped.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 73:2</a>) Something similar happened to a brother we will call Alberto.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>8.</strong><strong> What effect did injustice have on one brother?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Alberto was wrongly accused of stealing money from the congregation funds. As a result, he lost his privileges and the respect of many in the congregation who learned about the matter. “I felt bitter, angry, and frustrated,” he recalls. He allowed his emotional pain to affect his spirituality, and he even became inactive for five years. This experience illustrates what could happen if we were to become embittered by an injustice.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Jesus set a perfect example of how to cope with injustice. Consider the unjust treatment he experienced, both <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>from family and from outsiders. His unbelieving relatives accused him of being out of his mind, the religious leaders accused him of collaborating with the demons, and Roman soldiers mocked him, physically assaulted him, and eventually killed him.

<br/><strong>12.</strong><strong> How do we entrust ourselves to “the One who judges righteously”?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> We can also imitate Jesus by entrusting ourselves to “the One who judges righteously.” When others misjudge us or mistreat us, we trust that Jehovah knows the truth. That confidence can help us to endure unfair treatment because we know that ultimately Jehovah will correct matters. By leaving things with Jehovah, we prevent anger or resentment from festering in our heart. Those emotions can cause us to overreact, can destroy our joy, and can damage our relationship with Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 37:8</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

If that is true of you, be assured that Jehovah knows what you are going through. And Jesus, who also suffered unjustly, can sympathize with your feelings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024640/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb. 4:15, 16</a>) In addition to providing us with Jesus’ perfect example, Jehovah gives us practical counsel that helps us to deal with injustice.

<br/><strong>15.</strong><strong> Why is it best to wait on Jehovah to correct a matter?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> We benefit when we wait on Jehovah to correct a matter. If we do so, we will be spared the burden and frustration of trying to solve the problem ourselves. Jehovah offers to help us. He says, as it were, ‘Leave the injustice to me; I will take care of things.’ If we accept Jehovah’s promise “I will repay,” we can let the matter go, confident that he will handle it in the best possible way. That is what helped John, mentioned earlier. He said, “If I can just wait on Jehovah, he will handle it far better than I can.”
