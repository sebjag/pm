<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong><strong> How did Peter react to a miraculous catch of fish?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>PETER had spent an entire night fishing without catching anything. Surprisingly, Jesus said to him: “Pull out to where it is deep, and let down your nets for a catch.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 5:4</a>) Peter doubted that he would catch any fish, but he did as he was directed. The lowered nets began ripping apart from the weight of the catch. Realizing that they had just witnessed a miracle, Peter and those working with him were “overwhelmed with astonishment.” Peter exclaimed: “Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinful man.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 5:6-9</a>) Peter apparently felt unworthy even to be in Jesus’ presence.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong><strong> Why is it helpful for us to consider Peter’s example?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Peter was right​—he was “a sinful man.” The Scriptures show that he sometimes said and did things that he later regretted. Can you relate to Peter? Are you battling a personality flaw or a persistent sinful tendency? If so, you can gain hope by studying Peter’s example. How so? Consider this: Peter’s shortcomings could easily have been omitted from the Bible record. However, they were included under inspiration as lessons for us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) Learning about this man who had weaknesses and feelings like ours can help us to see that Jehovah does not expect perfection from us. He wants us to persevere​—to keep trying—​despite our weaknesses.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[2 Tim. 3:16, 17]</strong> <span id="v55-3-16-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070159/29961" class="vl vx vp study">16 </a>All Scripture is inspired of God<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070159/69" data-bid="70-1" class="b">+</a> and beneficial for teaching,<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070159/70" data-bid="71-1" class="b">+</a> for reproving, for setting things straight,<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070159/71" data-bid="72-1" class="b">+</a> for disciplining in righteousness,<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070159/72" data-bid="73-1" class="b">+</a> </span><span id="v55-3-17-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070159/29962" class="vl vx vp study">17 </a>so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.</span>

There is a saying, Practice makes perfect. To illustrate: A musician may spend many years mastering his instrument. During that time, he may play thousands of wrong notes, but if he keeps practicing, he will improve. Even if he becomes a skilled musician, though, he may occasionally make a mistake. Still, he does not give up. He keeps working at his craft. In a similar way, even after we feel that we have overcome a certain weakness, we may suffer a setback. But we still keep working toward our goal. We all say or do things that we later regret; nonetheless, if we refuse to give up, Jehovah will help us to keep making progress. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:10</a>) Let us consider Peter’s example of perseverance.

Jesus sensed Peter’s fear, which could have stemmed from feelings of inadequacy. Jesus also knew that Peter could remain faithful.

Peter and his brother Andrew later abandoned their fishing business and became full-time followers of the Messiah, a decision that led to remarkable blessings.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 1:16-18</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Jehovah and Jesus will not give up on us. Peter was at a critical crossroads in his life after he denied Christ. Would he quit, or would he persevere as Christ’s disciple? Jesus had supplicated Jehovah that Peter’s faith would not give out. Jesus told Peter about that prayer and expressed confidence that Peter would later be able to strengthen his brothers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Luke 22:31, 32</a>) How it must have reassured Peter to think back on Jesus’ words! When we come to a crossroads in our life, Jehovah may use caring shepherds to provide the assurance we need to remain faithful. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Eph. 4:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 11</a>) A longtime elder named Paul tries to provide that comfort. He asks those who feel like giving up to reflect on how Jehovah first drew them to the truth. He then assures them that Jehovah’s loyal love will not allow Him to give up on them. He concludes, <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>“I have seen many discouraged ones persevere with help from Jehovah.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

He was very poor, though, and doubted that he could support himself and remain in the full-time ministry. What would he do? He decided to put Jehovah to the test, spending the entire week in the ministry during the visit of the circuit overseer. At the end of the week, he was shocked when the circuit overseer handed him an envelope from an anonymous donor. It contained enough money to sustain him in the pioneer service for several months. Horst viewed this gift as reassurance that Jehovah would sustain him. He spent the rest of his life putting Kingdom interests first.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023565/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mal. 3:10</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
