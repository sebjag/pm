<br/><strong>FOCUS</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>To help us appreciate the need to avoid committing a sin as well as the steps that lead up to it.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> (a) What warning did Jesus give his disciples? (b) Why did the disciples give in to human weakness? (See also pictures.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“THE spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024485/0">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 26:41b</a>) With those words, Jesus showed that he understood our imperfect condition. But his words also included a warning: Beware of overconfidence. Earlier that very night, the disciples had confidently expressed their determination to stick by their Master. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 26:35</a>) Their motives were good. Still, they did not realize how quickly they could weaken under pressure. Thus, Jesus cautioned them: “Keep on the watch and pray continually, so that you may not enter into temptation.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 26:41a</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

So we may have the best of intentions to do what is right, but if we are not careful, we could give in to the temptation to do what the Bible says is wrong.

<br/> <strong>3.</strong><strong> (a) To remain loyal to Jehovah, why must we avoid overconfidence? (b) What will we discuss in this article?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> We cannot afford to be overconfident. True, we are determined to let nothing turn us away from Jehovah. Yet, we are also imperfect and vulnerable to temptation.

To remain loyal to Jehovah and his Son, we need to follow Jesus’ counsel to keep on guard against the temptation to sin. This article can help us do that. First, we will consider in <strong><em>what areas</em></strong> we must especially be on guard. Then, we will discuss <strong><em>how</em></strong> to guard ourselves against temptation. Finally, we will consider how to <strong><em>remain</em></strong> on guard.

<h2 class="du-color--coolGray-700 du-textAlign--center" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>KEEP ON GUARD​—IN WHAT AREAS?</strong></h2><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>4-5.</strong><strong> Why keep on guard even against minor sins?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Even sins that are relatively minor can weaken our relationship with Jehovah. Also, they can lead us to commit more serious sins.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> All of us face temptation to sin. But each one of us has areas of vulnerability, whether it is to commit a serious sin, to engage in some form of unclean conduct, or to fall prey to worldly thinking. For example, one person may be fighting temptation to commit sexual immorality. Another might be strongly inclined toward unclean practices, such as masturbation or viewing pornography. Still another may be struggling with fear of man, independent thinking, a quick temper, or something else. As James states, “each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by <strong><em>his own desire.”</em></strong>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Do you know in which areas <strong><em>you</em></strong> are most easily tempted? It does us no good to fool ourselves by denying our weaknesses or concluding that we are too strong to fall into wrongdoing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 John 1:8</a>) After all, Paul indicates that even those “who have spiritual qualifications” might give in to temptation if they do not keep on guard. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1</a>) We must be honest with ourselves and acknowledge the areas in which we are not strong.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Cor. 13:5</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>10.</strong><strong> How might a person today make the same mistake as the young man?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Solomon’s account illustrates what can happen to any worshipper of Jehovah. He might fall into serious sin and later feel that everything occurred “suddenly.” Or he might say, “It just happened.” And yet, if he thinks about what actually occurred, he will likely discover that he took some unwise steps that led to his transgression. Those steps might have involved bad association, unwholesome entertainment, or frequenting questionable places​—whether in person or online. Perhaps he had also stopped praying, reading the Bible, attending meetings, or sharing in the ministry. Like the young man discussed in Proverbs, he may not have committed the sin so “suddenly” after all.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>11.</strong><strong> To keep from falling into sin, what should we avoid?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> What is the lesson for us? We need to avoid not only the sin itself but also the steps that <strong><em>lead</em></strong> to sin. Solomon makes that very point after relating the account of the young man and the immoral woman. Referring to the woman, he states: “Do not stray onto her <strong><em>paths.”</em></strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 7:25</a>) He also says of such a wayward woman: <strong><em>“Stay far away</em></strong> from her; <strong><em>do not go near</em></strong> the entrance of her house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 5:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 8</a>) Yes, we guard ourselves from sin by keeping far away from the circumstances that lead to it.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024485/1">b</a> This might include avoiding certain situations or activities that are not off-limits for Christians in general but that are known to lead us into temptation.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 5:29, 30</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>13.</strong><strong> Why must we guard our thinking? (See also pictures.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> We must also guard our thinking. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ex. 20:17</a>) Some believe that there is nothing wrong with fantasizing about improper desires as long as an individual does not act on them. But such thinking is wrong. A person who dwells on a wrong desire intensifies the desire. In a sense, he creates a temptation, which he will now have to resist. Of course, wrong thoughts will at times come into our mind. The key is to reject these thoughts immediately and replace them with good ones. When we do, we keep wrong thoughts from growing into a powerful desire that is hard to fight and that might even lead us to committing a serious sin.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Col. 3:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jas. 1:13-15</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>17.</strong><strong> What tendency did Peter give in to on more than one occasion?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Likely, we can rid ourselves completely of some imperfect tendencies. But we might find that other inclinations continue to give us trouble. Consider the case of the apostle Peter. He gave in to fear of man when he denied Jesus three times.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024485/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 5:27-29</a>) However, some years later, “fearing those of the circumcised class,” he temporarily stopped eating with Gentile Christians.

<br/><strong>18.</strong><strong> What can happen with regard to some wrong tendencies?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> We might find ourselves in a similar situation. How? A tendency that we thought we had put behind us might return to tempt us again. For example, one brother admits: “I resisted pornography for ten years and convinced myself that my problem was over. But the addiction was lying dormant, waiting for the right circumstance to rear its ugly head.” Commendably, he did not <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>give up. He realized that he would need to put forth a daily effort to resist this vice​—perhaps for the rest of his life in this system of things. With the help of his wife and his congregation elders, he took stronger measures to resist pornography.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>19.</strong><strong> How can we resist a persistent tendency?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> How can we resist a persistent tendency so that we do not act on it? By following Jesus’ counsel with regard to temptation: “Keep on the watch.” Even during periods when you feel strong, continue to avoid situations that can lead to temptation.
