<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>AS JEHOVAH’S people, we preach to others because we love our heavenly Father and we want to help our neighbors come to know him. Many publishers really enjoy the preaching work. But others struggle to find pleasure in it. Why? Some may be very shy and lack confidence. Some feel uncomfortable going to people’s homes uninvited. Some may fear being rejected. Some have been taught to avoid conflict with others. Despite loving Jehovah very much, these brothers and sisters find it hard to approach strangers with the good news. Yet, they realize how important this work is, and they regularly have a share in it. How pleased Jehovah must be!</p><br/>&nbsp;

If so, do not be discouraged. Your lack of confidence may indicate that you humbly want to avoid drawing attention to yourself and do not want to be in the middle of controversy. And no one wants to be rejected, especially when he is trying to do good for others. Your heavenly Father is well-aware of the challenges you face and wants to give you the help you need.

Take, for example, the prophet Jeremiah. He was hesitant when Jehovah gave him the assignment to preach. Jeremiah said: “I do not know how to speak, for I am just a boy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024360/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 1:6</a>) How did he overcome his lack of confidence? He drew strength from God’s word. He said: “It became like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was tired of holding it in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024360/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 20:8, 9</a>) Although Jeremiah had a difficult territory, the message he was assigned to proclaim gave him the strength he needed to do the work.</p><br/>&nbsp;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Samuel and Dania were confined to their home. Throughout that difficult time, they regularly did telephone witnessing, wrote letters, and conducted Bible studies over Zoom. Samuel witnessed to those he met at the clinic where he was receiving treatments for cancer. He states: “Hardships wear us down mentally, physically, and spiritually. We need to find joy in our service to Jehovah.” In the midst of this, Dania fell and was confined to bed for three months. Then she needed a wheelchair for six months. She says: “I tried to do all that my circumstances allowed. I was able to preach to a nurse who visited, and I spoke to those who delivered things to the house. I also had good conversations on the telephone with a representative of a medical firm.” Samuel and Dania’s circumstances limited their activity, but they did what they could and found joy in doing so.</p><br/>&nbsp;
