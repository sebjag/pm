<br/><em>“You will again see the distinction between a righteous person and a wicked person, between one serving God and one not serving him.”</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">MAL. 3:18</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>FOCUS</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>To learn how Jehovah evaluated the kings of Israel so that we can understand what he is looking for in his worshippers today.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> What does the Bible reveal about some of the kings of Israel?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE Bible names more than 40 men who ruled as kings of Israel.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024486/0">a</a> That record candidly reveals intriguing details about some of them. For example, even the good kings did some bad things. Consider good King David. Jehovah said: “My servant David . . . walked after me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 14:8</a>) Yet, that man committed sexual immorality with a married woman and conspired to have her husband killed in battle.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 11:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[a]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> In this article, the expression “kings of Israel” refers to all the kings who ruled over Jehovah’s people, whether they reigned over the two-tribe kingdom of Judah, the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel, or all 12 tribes.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> On the other hand, many of the unfaithful kings did some good things. Consider Rehoboam.

<br/> <strong>3.</strong><strong> What important question arises, and what will we discuss in this article?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> An important question arises. If Israel’s kings did good and bad things, on what basis did Jehovah determine whether a king was faithful in His eyes? The answer to that question will help us understand what Jehovah is looking for in <strong><em>us.</em></strong> We will discuss three factors that Jehovah <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>evidently took into consideration when evaluating the kings of Israel: their <strong><em>heart condition,</em></strong> their <strong><em>repentance,</em></strong> and their <strong><em>adherence to true worship.</em></strong>

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The kings who pleased Jehovah worshipped him with a complete <strong><em>heart.</em></strong><a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024486/1">b</a> Good King Jehoshaphat “searched for Jehovah with all his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 22:9</a>) Speaking of Josiah, the inspired record says: “There was no king like him prior to him, who returned to Jehovah with all his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Ki. 23:25</a>) What about Solomon, who in his later years did what was bad? “His heart was not complete.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:4</a>) And regarding Abijam, another unfaithful king, the Bible record states: “His heart was not complete with Jehovah.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:3</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[b]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> EXPRESSION EXPLAINED: The Bible often uses the word “heart” to describe the complete inner person, including one’s desires, thoughts, disposition, attitude, capabilities, motivations, and goals.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> What does it mean, then, to serve Jehovah with a complete heart?

<br/> <strong>7.</strong><strong> Why is it important to avoid bad influences?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We must not let our heart become divided. If we are not careful, we could fool ourselves into thinking that by increasing our spiritual activities, we need not reject bad influences. To illustrate, imagine yourself outside on a brutally cold and windy day. On arriving home, you turn on the heat. How much good would that do you if you left the door open? The cold air would quickly fill your house. The point? We need to do more than just take in spiritual food that warms our relationship with Jehovah. We must also close the door on unwholesome influences, so that this world’s cold “air,” or ungodly attitude, does not enter our heart and divide it.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2</a>.

<br/><strong>14.</strong><strong> (a) Why did Jehovah regard King Rehoboam as unfaithful? (b) What characterized the reigns of the unfaithful kings?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Consider another unfaithful king​—Rehoboam.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Why was the issue of worship so important to Jehovah?

<br/><strong>16.</strong><strong> In Jehovah’s eyes, what especially distinguishes the righteous from the wicked?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> What lessons can we learn? Certainly, we must be determined to avoid false worship. But we must also adhere to true worship and remain active in it. The prophet Malachi stated plainly what in Jehovah’s eyes distinguishes a good person from a bad one. He wrote: “You will again see the distinction between a righteous person and a wicked person, between one <strong><em>serving God</em></strong> and one <strong><em>not serving him.”</em></strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mal. 3:18</a>) Therefore, we must not allow anything​—not even our imperfections and mistakes—​to discourage us to the point that we quit serving God.

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> You Can Return to Jehovah!</h2>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83">Consider the example of King Manasseh, who “did on a grand scale what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.” He “shed innocent blood in very great quantity,” engaged in various forms of spiritism, and even offered his sons in sacrifice to false gods! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 16</a>) He influenced the nation of Judah to “do greater evil than the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 33:1-6</a>) But when Manasseh was taken captive to Babylon, he repented. This involved more than one appeal for forgiveness. After all, he had made a practice of grave sin over a long period of time. In his distress, Manasseh <strong><em>“kept</em></strong> humbling himself” and <strong><em>“kept</em></strong> praying.” With what result? Jehovah heard Manasseh and “was <strong><em>moved by</em></strong> his entreaty.” Jehovah forgave him and restored him to Jerusalem and to his kingship.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024486/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p84" data-pid="84">Will Jehovah deal similarly with others who have left true worship but who show genuine, heartfelt repentance?
