<br/>How to imitate the example Jesus set during his final 40 days on earth.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> What happened as two of Jesus’ disciples walked toward Emmaus?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IT IS Nisan 16, 33 C.E. Jesus’ disciples are numb with grief and paralyzed by fear. Two of them leave Jerusalem and head for Emmaus, a village about 11 kilometers (7 mi) from Jerusalem. These men are dejected because Jesus, the man they had been following, had just been put to death. Their hope for what the Messiah would do seems lost. But the men are in for a surprise.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> A stranger approaches and walks with them. The disciples relate their disappointment about what happened to Jesus. The stranger then begins a life-changing discussion with them. “Starting with Moses and all the Prophets,” he explains why the Messiah had to suffer and die. When the three men arrive at Emmaus, the stranger reveals who he is​—the resurrected Jesus! We can only imagine the disciples’ joy on learning that the Messiah was alive!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 24:13-35</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

In this article, we will see how Jesus used this time (1) to encourage his disciples, (2) to deepen their understanding of the Scriptures, and (3) to train them to take on greater responsibilities. In each case, we will see how we can imitate Jesus’ example.

<br/> <strong>6.</strong><strong> What did Jesus do after he was resurrected?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> No doubt Jesus saw his disciples’ grief, not as a sign of spiritual weakness, but as an understandable response to a terrible loss. So on the very day that he was resurrected, he began encouraging his friends. For instance, he appeared to Mary Magdalene while she wept at his tomb. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 20:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16</a>) He also appeared to the two disciples described at the outset of this article.

<br/> <strong>8.</strong><strong> How can we imitate Jesus?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>How can we imitate Jesus?</em></strong> We can do much to motivate our brothers and sisters to keep serving Jehovah if, like Jesus, we are aware of their distresses and speak to them with empathy. Consider the experience of a sister named Jocelyn, whose sister died in a tragic accident. “For many months, I was in a constant state of deep grief,” she says. However, a brother and his wife invited her to their home, listened to her empathetically, and reassured her of her value in God’s eyes. Jocelyn says: “I felt as if Jehovah had used them to pull me out of a dark stormy sea and into a lifeboat. They helped me to regain my desire to keep serving Jehovah.” We too can encourage others by listening attentively as they pour out their heart and by speaking empathetically, with a view to strengthening them in their service to God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 12:15</a>.

<br/><strong>11-12.</strong><strong> (a) What lesson can we learn from the way Jesus taught Bible truths? (See also pictures.) (b) How did Nortey’s Bible teacher help him?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>How can we imitate Jesus?</em></strong> First, when teaching Bible students, ask tactful <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>questions that will draw out what is in their mind and heart. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 20:5</a>) Once you understand their feelings, show them how to find specific scriptures that apply to their circumstances. Then resist the urge to tell them what to do. Instead, help them to reason on the Scriptures and to discern how they can apply Bible principles in their life. Consider the experience of a brother in Ghana named Nortey.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> When Nortey was 16 years old, he began to study the Bible. Soon, though, his family opposed him. What helped him to remain firm? His Bible teacher had used <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 10</a> to explain that true Christians will be persecuted. “So when the persecution started,” Nortey says, “I was convinced that I had found the truth.” His teacher also helped him to reason on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 10:16</a> so that he could be both cautious and respectful when discussing religious matters at home. After his baptism, Nortey wanted to pioneer, but his father expected him to go to university. Rather than tell Nortey what to do, his teacher drew him out with questions and helped him to reason on Scriptural principles. The result? Nortey decided to enter full-time service. His father made him leave home. How does Nortey feel about these events? “I am convinced that I made the right choice,” he says. When we too take time to help others reason on the Scriptures, we can help them become solid Christians.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 3:16-19</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>17.</strong><strong> How did Jesus show that he trusted his disciples?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Jesus gave his disciples the responsibility not only to preach but also to teach. (See “<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/2024602/2/0">teaching them</a>” study note on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matthew 28:20</a>.) The disciples may have felt unqualified for that assignment. However, Jesus did not doubt that they could do the work, and he told them so. Expressing complete confidence in them, Jesus said: “Just as the Father has sent me, I also am sending you.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 20:21</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>18.</strong><strong> How can elders imitate Jesus?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>How can elders imitate Jesus?</em></strong> Experienced elders delegate responsibilities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024602/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Phil. 2:19-22</a>) For example, elders can involve young ones in Kingdom Hall cleaning and maintenance. After delegating a task, they can express their confidence in those selected to carry it out by training them and then trusting them to do the work correctly. A new elder named Matthew says that he truly appreciates experienced elders who train him thoroughly to handle an assignment and then trust him to complete it. He says, “I have benefited when they viewed my mistakes as part of the learning process and then helped me to improve.”<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024602/3">d</a><br/>&nbsp;
