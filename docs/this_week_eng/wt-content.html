<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> Why might we feel that Jehovah is not answering our prayers?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;

But should we expect Jehovah to give us everything we ask for right away? Why might we ask that question? Consider the following scenarios. A single sister prays about attending the School for Kingdom Evangelizers. But several years go by, and she has still not been invited. A young brother asks Jehovah to be relieved of a debilitating disease so that he can serve in the congregation more fully. But his health does not improve. Christian parents pray that their child will stay in the truth. But their child decides to stop serving Jehovah.</p><br/>&nbsp;

As a result, you may conclude that Jehovah answers some prayers but not yours. Or you may reason that you must have done something wrong. A sister named Janice<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023647/1">b</a> felt that way. She and her husband prayed about their desire to serve at Bethel. She says: “I was convinced that we would be at Bethel in no time.” But months turned into years, and the couple had still not been invited. Janice says: “I felt sad and confused. I wondered what I had done to disappoint Jehovah. I had prayed so specifically for his direction. <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>Why had he not answered my prayer?”</p><br/>&nbsp;

A sister named Anna had that experience. She prayed that her husband, Matthew, might recover from cancer. At the same time, two elderly Christian sisters were also battling cancer. Anna prayed intensely for Matthew and for the sisters. The sisters recovered, but Matthew passed away. At first, Anna wondered if the sisters got well because Jehovah intervened.

If Jehovah had miraculously cured him, Satan could have argued that the brother continued serving Jehovah only because he had been healed.
