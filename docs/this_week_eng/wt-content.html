Consider <strong><em>Jacob.</em></strong> He was commanded by his father to take a wife from the daughters of Laban, a believing relative, and was assured that Jehovah would bless him richly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023364/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 28:1-4</a>) So Jacob did the right thing. He left the land of Canaan and journeyed to the home of Laban, who had two daughters​—Leah and Rachel. Jacob fell in love with Laban’s younger daughter, Rachel, and agreed to work seven years for her father before marrying her. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023364/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 29:18</a>) But matters did not turn out as Jacob had hoped. Laban tricked him into marrying his older daughter, Leah. Laban allowed Jacob to marry Rachel a week later, but only if he worked seven more years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023364/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 29:25-27</a>) Laban was also unfair in his business dealings with Jacob.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> During the years leading up to 1914, Jehovah’s people had high expectations. Consider, for example, Brother A. H. Macmillan. Like many at that time, Brother Macmillan thought that he would receive his heavenly reward very soon. In a talk he gave in September 1914, he said: “This is probably the last public address I shall ever deliver.” Of course, that was not his last talk. Brother Macmillan later wrote: “Perhaps some of us had been a bit too hasty in thinking that we were going to heaven right away.” He added: “The thing for us to do would be to keep busy in the Lord’s service.” Brother Macmillan did keep busy. He was zealous in the ministry. He had the privilege of encouraging many brothers who were in prison for their neutrality. And he faithfully attended congregation meetings even in his later years. How did Brother Macmillan benefit from using his time productively while he waited for his reward? Shortly before his death in 1966, he wrote: “My faith is as strong today as it ever was.” What an excellent attitude for all of us to imitate​—especially if we have been enduring longer than we anticipated!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023364/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

One sister wrote: “I have never been as deeply moved as I was when I read this article. . . . Reading how Brother Jennings had to give up an assignment to care for his illness helped me to view my situation in a balanced way.” Similarly, a brother wrote: “After serving as a congregation elder for ten years, I had to relinquish my privilege because of a mental illness. My feelings of failure were such that it was often too depressing for me to read the life-story articles. . . .

For example, a widow in Nigeria was very low on provisions. One morning, her daughter asked her what they were going to eat after they cooked their last cup of rice. Our sister told her daughter that they did not have any money or food left but that they should imitate the widow of Zarephath​—prepare their last meal and put their complete trust in Jehovah.

<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu"><strong>19.</strong><strong> What persecution has Aleksey Yershov endured?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> In recent years, many of our brothers and sisters have endured persecution that they may not have expected. Consider Brother Aleksey Yershov, who lives in Russia. Jehovah’s people in that area enjoyed a measure of freedom when Brother Yershov was baptized in 1994. In later years, though, the situation in Russia changed. In 2020, Brother Yershov’s home was invaded and searched, and many of his possessions were confiscated. Several months later, the government filed criminal charges against him. To make matters worse, the charges were based on video recordings made by a person who pretended for over a year to be interested in studying the Bible. What a betrayal!</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu"><strong>20.</strong><strong> How has Brother Yershov strengthened his relationship with Jehovah?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Has anything good come out of Brother Yershov’s ordeal? Yes. His relationship with Jehovah has grown stronger. “My wife and I pray together more frequently,” he says. “I realize that I would not be able to manage this situation without Jehovah’s help.” He adds: “Personal study helps me to deal with discouragement. I meditate on the examples of faithful servants in the past. There are many accounts recorded in the Bible highlighting how important it is to keep calm and to show trust in Jehovah.”</p><br/>&nbsp;
