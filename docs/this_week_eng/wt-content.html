<br/>Learning practical lessons from the letter to the Hebrews will help us to endure faithfully to the end of this system of things.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> (a) What was the situation in Judea when the apostle Paul wrote the letter to the Hebrews? (b) How did this inspired letter prove timely?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>HEBREW Christians living in Jerusalem and Judea went through hard times in the years following Jesus’ death. Soon after the Christian congregation was formed, intense persecution arose against it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 8:1</a>) Then some 20 years later, Christ’s followers faced serious economic hardships, possibly caused by a famine that had previously afflicted the land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 11:27-30</a>) However, about 61 C.E., Christians were experiencing a time of relative peace compared with what was to come. During that period, they received an inspired letter from the apostle Paul​—a letter that would prove to be very timely.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The letter to the Hebrews was timely because the peace that the Christians were experiencing would not last. Paul provided practical counsel that would help those Christians to endure the tribulation that they would soon face. The destruction of the Jewish system of things, which Jesus had foretold, was approaching. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:20</a>) Of course, neither Paul nor the Christians in Judea knew exactly when that destruction would occur. Nevertheless, those Christians could use the time remaining to prepare themselves by building up such qualities as faith and endurance.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12:1, 2</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>4.</strong><strong> What challenges did Jewish Christians face? (See also picture.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Christians of a Jewish background faced a big challenge. At one time, the Jews had been Jehovah’s chosen people. Jerusalem was the earthly seat of God’s Kingdom, and the temple was the center of pure worship. All faithful Jews followed the Mosaic Law as explained by their religious leaders. Those teachings governed their diet, their view of circumcision, and even their association with Gentiles. However, Jehovah no longer accepted the Jewish sacrifices after Jesus’ death. That presented a challenge for Jewish Christians who were used to following the Law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 10:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 10</a>) Even mature Christians, such as the apostle Peter, struggled to adapt to some of these changes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 10:9-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Gal. 2:11-14</a>) Because of their new beliefs, those Christians became a target of the Jewish religious leaders.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Hebrew Christians would have to endure tests of their faith as conditions in Judea deteriorated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Heb. 10:36</a>) Although some Hebrew Christians had faced intense persecution, many had accepted Christianity during a period of relative peace.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Heb. 12:4</a>) With the spread of Christianity, however, the Jewish opposers were becoming increasingly bitter and fanatical. Just a few years earlier, Paul’s appearance in Jerusalem stirred up a riot. More than 40 Jews “bound themselves with a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 22:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 23:12-14</a>) Despite such a climate of religious fanaticism and hatred, those Christians would still need to meet for worship, preach the good news, and keep themselves strong in the faith.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>17.</strong><strong> What had Paul learned about enduring persecution?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Paul urged the Hebrew Christians to endure trials with greater determination. He was in a good position to write to them about this. As a former persecutor of Christians, he knew what they were up against. He also knew how to endure persecution. After all, he experienced various forms of opposition after becoming a Christian.

He reminded those Christians that when enduring trials, they needed to rely not on themselves but on Jehovah. Paul could say with courage: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Heb. 13:6</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>19.</strong><strong> Taking what practical steps can help us to prepare for the great tribulation? (See also picture.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> No doubt Paul’s letter to the Hebrews helped first-century Christians to prepare for the tribulation that they would face. Paul urged his brothers to gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures. Doing so would equip them to identify and reject teachings that would undermine their faith. He encouraged them to strengthen their faith so that they would promptly follow the direction of Jesus and of those taking the lead in the congregation. And he helped Christians to build endurance by having the right view of trials and seeing the trials as an opportunity to be trained by their loving Father. May we too apply this inspired counsel. We will then be able to endure faithfully down to the end.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024561/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Heb. 3:14</a>.<br/>&nbsp;
