During his decades of faithful service, he walked with Jesus, opened up new fields for preaching, and served as a member of the governing body. But Peter’s service was not over. In about 62-64 C.E., he was inspired to write two letters​—the Bible books of 1 and 2 Peter. He expressed his hope that these letters would help Christians after his death.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023566/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:12-15</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong><strong> Why should we examine Peter’s inspired letters?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;

So we can now benefit from those letters. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023566/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) Living in a world that promotes unclean conduct, we also face trials that can make it difficult to serve Jehovah. Furthermore, we will soon experience a tribulation greater than the one that brought an end to the Jewish systems. We find some vital reminders in Peter’s two letters. These will help us to keep in expectation of Jehovah’s day, overcome fear of man, and cultivate intense love for one another. Such reminders can also help elders see how to care successfully for the needs of the flock.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Peter urged us to “love one another intensely from the heart.” In this context, to love “intensely” involves stretching the limits of our natural inclination to love. For example, what if a brother offends or hurts us in some way? Our instinct may be to retaliate rather than to show love. Yet, Peter learned from Jesus that retaliation does not please God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023566/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 18:10, 11</a>) Peter wrote: “Do not pay back injury for injury or insult for insult.

At the time, Peter likely believed that he was being generous when he suggested that he would forgive his brother “up to seven times.” But Jesus taught him​—and us—​to forgive “up to 77 times,” meaning without limit.

Some also have responsibilities as members of Hospital Liaison Committees or accept assignments with the Local Design/​Construction Department. Elders are truly busy men!</p><br/>&nbsp;

However, you may at times feel that you are so busy or so tired that you cannot fulfill that assignment. What can you do? Pour out your concerns to Jehovah. Peter wrote: “If anyone ministers, let him do so as depending on the strength that God supplies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023566/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:11</a>) Your brothers and sisters may be facing problems that cannot be fully solved in this system of things.

As the COVID-19 pandemic began, he and his fellow elders made it a priority to contact each individual in their assigned group every week. He explains why: “Many of the brothers were home alone with their thoughts, and their thinking could quickly have turned negative.” When a fellow believer is struggling, William listens carefully to determine his or her needs and concerns. <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>Then he finds specific resources, often videos from our website, to help the fellow servant.
