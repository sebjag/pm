<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WE ALL appreciate people who are patient. Why is that the case? We respect those who can wait for something without getting frustrated. We appreciate that others are patient with us when we make mistakes. And we are grateful that our Bible teacher was patient with us as we struggled to learn, accept, or apply a Bible teaching. Above all, how thankful we are that Jehovah God is patient with us!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 2:4</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

And, at times, we could find it hard to keep waiting for Jehovah’s promised new world. Would you like to be more patient? In this article, we will consider what it means to be patient and why it is so important. We will also review what can help us to develop more patience.</p><br/>&nbsp;

First, <strong><em>a patient person is slow to anger.</em></strong> He tries to stay <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>calm and to hold back from retaliating when provoked or under stress. The phrase “slow to anger” first appears in the Bible when Jehovah is described as “a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

For example, we need to listen patiently while someone is speaking, without interrupting. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 36:2</a>) We may also need patience when helping a student to understand a Bible teaching or to overcome a bad habit.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Of course, it is not wrong to open up to a close friend and express how we feel about a trial. However, a patient person will do his best to continue enduring while maintaining a positive attitude.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong><strong> According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">James 5:7, 8</a>, why is patience so important? (See also picture.)</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Patience is essential for our salvation. Like faithful servants of the past, we need to wait patiently for God to fulfill his promises. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 6:11, 12</a>) The Bible compares our situation to that of a farmer. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>James 5:7, 8</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> A farmer works hard to plant and water his crop, but he does not know exactly when it will grow. So the farmer waits patiently, trusting that he will reap a crop. Likewise, we stay busy in spiritual activities even though we “do not know on what day [our] Lord is coming.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 24:42</a>) We wait patiently, confident that in his due time, Jehovah will fulfill all that he has promised. If we were to become impatient, we might get tired of waiting and start drifting away from the truth. We could also begin to pursue things that might give us instant gratification. But if we are patient, we can endure to the end and be saved.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mic. 7:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:13</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Maybe we expected the end to come long ago. We may fear that we will not live long enough to see it. What can help us to continue to wait patiently? Consider Abraham’s example. When Abraham was a childless 75-year-old man, Jehovah promised him: “I will make you a great nation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-4</a>) Did Abraham see that promise fulfilled? Not completely. After crossing the Euphrates River and waiting 25 years, Abraham did see the miraculous birth of his son Isaac, and after another 60 years, his grandsons Esau and Jacob were born. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 6:15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> But Abraham never saw his descendants become a great nation and inherit the Promised Land. However, that faithful man did enjoy a close friendship with his Creator. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023527/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jas. 2:23</a>) And when Abraham is resurrected, how thrilled he will be to learn that his faith and patience resulted in blessings for all nations!
