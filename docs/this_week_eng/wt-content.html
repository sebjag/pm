Still, David at times struggled to be obedient, and so do we. Why? First, we have inherited a tendency to be disobedient. Second, Satan constantly tries to incite us to rebel, as he did. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023601/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:3</a>) Third, we are surrounded by this world’s rebellious attitude, “the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023601/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2</a>) We must work hard not only to fight our tendency to sin but also to resist the pressure that the Devil and this world put on us to disobey. We must put forth effort to obey Jehovah and those whom he has appointed to a position of authority.</p><br/>&nbsp;

It was ultimately Joseph and Mary’s responsibility to make sure that all their children were among the group who were traveling home after the festival. When Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus, Mary blamed him for the trouble he had caused them! Jesus could have pointed out how unjust this was. Instead, he gave his parents a simple and respectful reply. Joseph and Mary, however, “did not understand what he was saying to them.” Still, Jesus “continued subject to them.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>6-7.</strong><strong> What can help young people to obey their parents?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Young ones, do you ever find it hard to obey your parents when they make mistakes or when they misunderstand you? What can help? First, think about how Jehovah feels. The Bible says that when you obey your parents, “this is well-pleasing to the Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023601/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Col. 3:20</a>) Jehovah knows when your parents do not fully understand you or when they make rules that are less than perfect. But when you choose to obey them anyway, you make him happy.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[Col. 3:20]</strong> <span id="v51-3-20-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070155/29629" class="vl vx vp study">20 </a>You children, be obedient to your parents in everything,<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070155/117" data-bid="118-1" class="b">+</a> for this is well-pleasing to the Lord. </span>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Many young people have seen how well things turn out when they obey. Luiza, also from Brazil, found it hard at first to understand why she was not allowed to have a cell phone for a time. After all, she reasoned, most people her age had one. But then she realized that her parents were actually protecting her. She now says, “I see obeying my parents, not as a straitjacket, but as a seat belt that can save my life.” Elizabeth, a young sister from the United States, still struggles to obey her parents at times. She explains, “When I do not fully understand why my parents put a certain rule in place, I think back to the times when their rules protected me.” Monica, who lives in Armenia, says that things have always worked out better for her when she obeyed her parents rather than when she disobeyed them.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> A sister named Stephanie had a hard time accepting a decision made by responsible brothers in her country. She and her husband were happily serving in a foreign-language group. Then the branch office discontinued the group, and the couple were assigned back to a congregation in their native language. “I was very unhappy,” admits Stephanie. <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>“I wasn’t convinced that there was a greater need in our mother tongue.” Even so, she decided to support the new direction. “In time, I came to see the wisdom of this decision,” she says. “We have become spiritual parents to several in our congregation who do not have family in the truth. I am studying with a newly reactivated sister. And now I have more time for personal study.” She adds, “I have a clear conscience, knowing that I have done my best to be obedient.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

For example, during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic when we were asked to stop meeting at our Kingdom Halls and to suspend our house-to-house ministry, did you struggle to obey? Yet, your obedience protected you, united you with fellow believers, and pleased Jehovah. All of us are now better prepared to obey any instructions we receive during the great tribulation.
