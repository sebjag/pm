A young brother named Jordan asked an elder how he could do more to help in the congregation. The elder commended him for the progress that he had already made and then gave him some advice on how he could do more. For example, he suggested that Jordan arrive early at the Kingdom Hall and greet others, participate at the meetings, preach regularly with his field service group, and look for practical ways to help others. When Jordan applied this advice, he was not simply learning new skills but also growing in his love for his brothers and sisters. Jordan learned that when a brother becomes a ministerial servant, he does not <strong><em>begin</em></strong> helping others; rather, he <strong><em>continues</em></strong> helping them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023481/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:8-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023481/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> When we show love to others, we ourselves benefit in unexpected ways. Jonathan, who lives in New Zealand, confirms this. One hot Saturday afternoon, he saw a pioneer witnessing along the road. Jonathan decided to work with the pioneer on subsequent Saturday afternoons. He did not realize at the time how much he himself would benefit from this act of kindness. “At that point in my life,” Jonathan admits, “I did not love field service. But as I listened to the pioneer’s way of teaching and saw how fruitful his ministry was, it stirred in me a real love for this work. I also gained a great friend who helped me to grow spiritually, to enjoy the ministry, and to draw closer to Jehovah.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Jehovah wants all of us to grow in love for him and for others. As we have learned, we can strengthen our love for Jehovah by reading his Word and meditating on it and by regularly talking to him in prayer. We can grow in our love for our brothers and sisters by assisting them in practical ways. As our love grows, we will draw ever closer to Jehovah and to our spiritual family. And we will enjoy those friendships forever!</p><br/>&nbsp;
