How should we conduct ourselves if we want to continue as his guests? If you were invited to someone’s home, you would want to know what he expects of you. For example, he might expect you to remove your shoes before entering, and you would willingly comply. Likewise, we certainly want to know what Jehovah requires of those who want to continue being guests in his tent. Our love for Jehovah moves us to do everything in our power “to please him fully.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024445/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Col. 1:10</a>) And while we view Jehovah as our Friend, we realize that he is also our God and Father, who is worthy of our respect.

Levites were assigned to share in other duties related to that holy tent. Did those who served at the tabernacle or who were encamped close to it enjoy better care from Jehovah than others? No!
