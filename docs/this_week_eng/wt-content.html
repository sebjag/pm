<br/><strong>FOCUS</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>How the elders try to help those in the congregation who get involved in serious sin.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/> <strong>1.</strong><strong> What is true of some who commit a serious sin?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IN THE preceding article, we saw how the apostle Paul handled a case of serious wrongdoing in Corinth. The sinner was unrepentant and had to be removed from the congregation. However, as our theme text shows, some who have committed a serious sin can be reached. They can be led to repentance. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024533/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 2:4</a>) How can the elders help them to repent?<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Before the elders can help, they need to be aware of the matter.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> What, though, if the wrongdoer refuses to speak to the elders? Then we would go to the elders ourselves to make sure that the person will get the necessary help. That is the loving thing to do because we do not want to lose our brother or sister. If the wrongdoer continues in his course, he will further impair his relationship with Jehovah. He may also damage the reputation of the congregation. So we courageously take action out of love for Jehovah and for the wrongdoer.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024533/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 27:14</a>.

<br/> <strong>4.</strong><strong> What is the elders’ goal when they meet with someone who has committed a serious sin?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> When someone in the congregation commits a serious sin, the body of elders selects three qualified brothers from among them who will serve as a committee.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024533/0">a</a> These men need to be modest and humble. While they will try to help the erring one to repent, they recognize that they cannot force someone to change. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024533/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deut. 30:19</a>) The elders acknowledge that not all wrongdoers will respond in a positive way, as did King David. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024533/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:13</a>) Some wrongdoers may choose to ignore Jehovah’s admonition. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024533/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 4:6-8</a>) Nevertheless, the elders’ goal is to lead the wrongdoer to repentance if at all possible. What principles guide them as they meet with the wrongdoer?<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[a]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> In the past, these groups were called judicial committees. But since judging is only one aspect of their work, we will no longer use that expression. Instead, we will simply refer to this group as a committee of elders.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>The elders try to determine the circumstances that led up to the sin.</em></strong> For example, did the Christian slowly become weak because he neglected personal study or the ministry?

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> By asking meaningful questions without being unnecessarily intrusive, the elders kindly draw out the wrongdoer and help him to reason on his course.

<br/><strong>12-13.</strong><strong> How might the elders give a wrongdoer time to repent? (See also picture.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> In imitation of Jesus, the elders are not hasty to conclude that a wrongdoer will not repent. While some may repent during the committee’s first meeting with them, others may need more time. So the elders may arrange to meet with the sinner more than once. Perhaps after that first meeting, the erring Christian will begin to think seriously about what he has been told. He may approach Jehovah in humble prayer.

<br/><strong>19.</strong><strong> How do elders strive to imitate Jehovah when dealing with wrongdoers?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Elders who serve on committees have a responsibility before Jehovah to keep the congregation clean. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024533/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:7</a>) They also want wrongdoers to be moved to repentance if possible. To that end, elders maintain a positive, hopeful outlook. Why? Because they want to imitate Jehovah, who is “very tender in affection and merciful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024533/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jas. 5:11</a>) Note how the aged apostle John showed such a spirit. He wrote: “My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin. And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024533/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 John 2:1</a>.<br/>&nbsp;
