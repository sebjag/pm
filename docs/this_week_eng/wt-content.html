<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHEN the Bible speaks of “Jehovah’s day,” it refers to the time when Jehovah judges his enemies and brings salvation to his people. In the past, Jehovah at times carried out judgments.

To survive that “day,” we need to prepare now.

The light of a new day might catch them off guard and expose them. The great tribulation will likewise expose those who, like thieves, remain in darkness by persisting in works that displease God.

They are unaware of their surroundings or the passing of time. Hence, they cannot discern important developments or respond to them. Most people today are asleep in a spiritual sense. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023441/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 11:8</a>) They are indifferent to evidence that we are living in “the last days” and that the great tribulation will come soon. Major world events may rouse some from spiritual slumber and move them to show a little interest in our Kingdom message. Yet, many go back to sleep rather than stay awake. Even some who believe in a day of judgment think that it is far off.

People under the influence of alcohol are slow to respond to what is happening around them, and they make poor decisions. Similarly, the wicked do not respond to God’s warnings. They choose a course that leads to their destruction. But Christians are told to keep their senses, to be sober. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023441/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:6</a>) One Bible scholar describes this soberness as “a calm, steady state of mind which weighs and estimates things aright and thus enables us to make the right decision.” Why must we keep calm and steady? So that we do not get caught up in today’s political or social issues. The pressure to take sides in these matters will increase as Jehovah’s day draws closer. Still, we need not be anxious about how we will respond. God’s spirit can help us to have a calm and steady state of mind and to make wise decisions.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023441/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 12:11, 12</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Instead of naively accepting what others say, we use our thinking ability to compare what we read or what we hear with what the Bible and Jehovah’s organization say.
