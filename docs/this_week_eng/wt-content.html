<br/><strong>FOCUS</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>Why some individuals need to be removed from the congregation and how elders can help such ones to repent and be restored to Jehovah’s favor.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> (a) How does Jehovah view willful sin? (b) What is Jehovah’s hope toward wrongdoers?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JEHOVAH is not a permissive God; he does not condone sin.

Of course, Jehovah does not expect perfection from imperfect people.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> When an unrepentant wrongdoer is removed from the congregation, an announcement is made to inform the congregation that he is no longer one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024534/1">b</a> The purpose of that announcement is not to humiliate the wrongdoer.

<br/> <strong>5.</strong><strong> How should we view a person who has been removed from the congregation, and why?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> How, then, should we view a fellow believer who is removed from the congregation? Although we do not socialize with him, we should view him as a lost sheep, not a lost cause. A sheep that has strayed from the fold may well return. Remember, that lost sheep dedicated himself to Jehovah. Sadly, he is not living up to that dedication at present, and that puts him in a dangerous position. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:31</a>) Nevertheless, as long as Jehovah’s mercy is available, there is hope that the person will return. How do the elders reflect that hope even toward a wrongdoer who has been removed from the congregation?

<br/> <strong>6.</strong><strong> What steps will the elders take to assist one who has been removed from the congregation?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Is the individual who has been removed from the congregation abandoned​—left completely on his own to find his way back to Jehovah? By no means! When informing an unrepentant wrongdoer that he will be removed from the congregation, the committee of elders will explain to him what steps he can take to return to the congregation. But the elders will do even more. In most cases, they will tell the wrongdoer that they would like to meet with him again after a few months have passed to see if he has had a change of heart. If the wrongdoer is willing to meet with them <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>again, the elders will at that subsequent meeting make a warm appeal for him to repent and return.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> From what we have considered so far, it is clear that Jehovah does not condone unrepentant wrongdoing. However, he does not turn his back on wrongdoers. He wants them to return. Jehovah’s feelings toward repentant wrongdoers are expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hosea 14:4</a>: “I will heal their unfaithfulness.

<br/><strong>10-11.</strong><strong> How will the elders try to help those who in the past were removed from the congregation?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> What about individuals who in the past were removed from the congregation, perhaps many years ago? Such individuals may no longer be practicing the sin for which they were removed. In some situations, they may not even recall why they were removed. Whatever the case, the elders will try to locate and visit these individuals. During such visits, the elders will even offer to pray with them and make a warm appeal for them to return to the congregation. Of course, if a person has been away from the congregation for many years, he would no doubt be very weak spiritually. Therefore, if he indicates that he wants to return to the congregation, the elders might arrange for someone to conduct a Bible study with him, even though he has not yet been reinstated. <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>In all cases, the elders would be the ones to arrange for the Bible study.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> In certain circumstances the elders need to be especially careful before reinstating someone.

What if he <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>attends? In the past, we would not greet such a person.

<div class="padding"><strong>[Were John and Paul Discussing the Same Kind of Sin?]</strong> <strong>Help for Those Who Are Removed From the Congregation</strong><br/>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> Were John and Paul Discussing the Same Kind of Sin?</h2>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71">In his second inspired letter, the apostle John wrote: “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes <strong><em>or say a greeting to him.</em></strong> For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2 John 10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72">In stating that Christians should not even “say a greeting,” was John adding to the apostle Paul’s direction found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:11</a> “to stop keeping company” with people who had been removed from the congregation? Were John and Paul discussing the same kind of sin? Evidently not.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73">Consider the differences between the circumstances addressed by each apostle. Paul wrote with regard to a man who was committing sexual immorality. About 43 years later, John wrote with regard to apostates and others who actively promote false teachings and wrong conduct. For example, some were teaching that Jesus was not the Christ.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">1 John 2:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 4:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p74" data-pid="74">When John wrote his letters, apostasy was widespread. Although he knew that he could not prevent it, he fulfilled his responsibility as an apostle to act “as a restraint” against apostasy by holding it back as long as possible.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:7</a>.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75">Thus, John warned fellow believers to avoid being fooled by these deceivers and false teachers. He directed Christians never to accept such ones into their homes or even to greet them. Greeting someone who promotes falsehood would give him an opening for presenting his twisted, corrupt teachings. Something similar could happen if a person commented on apostate computer blogs or social media. Anyone who would welcome an apostate with a greeting would become “a sharer in his wicked works.”</p><p id="p76" data-pid="76">By contrast, Paul wrote with regard to a man who had to be removed from the congregation for sexual immorality, as indicated in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Corinthians chapter 5</a>. But that man was apparently not an apostate; nor was he actively teaching others to violate God’s standards. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Revelation 2:20</a>.) So while Paul directed those in the congregation to stop keeping company with him​—not even eating with him—​he did not state that they must never say a simple greeting.</p>
</div>

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Some may wonder, ‘Doesn’t the Bible say that a Christian who says a greeting to such a person becomes a sharer in his wicked works?’ <strong>(<span style="background-color:#b7ff95">Read</span> </strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>2 John 9-11</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> The context of this scripture shows that this direction refers to apostates and others who actively promote wrong conduct.

Of course, there is hope that he will come to his senses. Until that happens, though, we would neither greet such a person nor invite him to attend a congregation meeting.

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> Were John and Paul Discussing the Same Kind of Sin?</h2><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>In his second inspired letter, the apostle John wrote: “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes <strong><em>or say a greeting to him.</em></strong> For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2 John 10, 11</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

</div>

<br/>In stating that Christians should not even “say a greeting,” was John adding to the apostle Paul’s direction found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:11</a> “to stop keeping company” with people who had been removed from the congregation? Were John and Paul discussing the same kind of sin? Evidently not.<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[1 Corinthians 5:11]</strong> <span id="v46-5-11-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070150/28557" class="vl vx vp study">11 </a>But now I am writing you to stop keeping company<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070150/121" data-bid="122-1" class="b">+</a> with anyone called a brother who is sexually immoral or a greedy person<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070150/122" data-bid="123-1" class="b">+</a> or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070150/123" data-bid="124-1" class="b">+</a> or an extortioner,<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070150/124" data-bid="125-1" class="b">+</a> not even eating with such a man. </span>
</div>

<br/>Consider the differences between the circumstances addressed by each apostle. Paul wrote with regard to a man who was committing sexual immorality. About 43 years later, John wrote with regard to apostates and others who actively promote false teachings and wrong conduct. For example, some were teaching that Jesus was not the Christ.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">1 John 2:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 4:2, 3</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

</div>

<br/>When John wrote his letters, apostasy was widespread. Although he knew that he could not prevent it, he fulfilled his responsibility as an apostle to act “as a restraint” against apostasy by holding it back as long as possible.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:7</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[2 Thess. 2:7]</strong> <span id="v53-2-7-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070157/29760" class="vl vx vp study">7 </a>True, the mystery of this lawlessness is already at work,<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070157/20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">+</a> but only until the one who is right now acting as a restraint is out of the way. </span>
</div>

<br/>Thus, John warned fellow believers to avoid being fooled by these deceivers and false teachers. He directed Christians never to accept such ones into their homes or even to greet them. Greeting someone who promotes falsehood would give him an opening for presenting his twisted, corrupt teachings. Something similar could happen if a person commented on apostate computer blogs or social media. Anyone who would welcome an apostate with a greeting would become “a sharer in his wicked works.”<br/>&nbsp;
<br/>By contrast, Paul wrote with regard to a man who had to be removed from the congregation for sexual immorality, as indicated in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Corinthians chapter 5</a>. But that man was apparently not an apostate; nor was he actively teaching others to violate God’s standards. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024534/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Revelation 2:20</a>.) So while Paul directed those in the congregation to stop keeping company with him​—not even eating with him—​he did not state that they must never say a simple greeting.
