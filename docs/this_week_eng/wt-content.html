<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> We must, however, work hard to keep serving Jehovah faithfully. Why? Because we may at times be offended by the imperfections of others. We may also find it difficult to put up with our own shortcomings, especially if we make the same mistakes time and again. We need to persevere in Jehovah’s service (1) when a fellow believer offends us, (2) when our spouse disappoints us, and (3) when we are disappointed with ourselves. In this article, we will consider each of these situations. We will also consider what we can learn from a faithful Bible character.</p><br/>&nbsp;

For example, he was misjudged soon after he started to associate with the congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 9:26</a>) Later, some spoke about him behind his back to damage his reputation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:10</a>) Paul saw a responsible brother make a wrong decision that may have stumbled others.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 15:37, 38</a>) Paul could have allowed any one of these situations to cause him to refuse to associate with the offenders. Yet, he maintained a positive view of his brothers and sisters and remained active in Jehovah’s service. What helped Paul to persevere?</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[51]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>The challenge.</em></strong> All marriages have difficulties. The Bible frankly acknowledges that married people will have “tribulation in their flesh.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:28</a>) Why? Because marriage brings two imperfect people together, each with different characteristics, likes, and dislikes. Mates may come from different cultures or backgrounds. They may, in time, display traits that were not noticeable before the wedding. Any of those things can cause friction. Instead of recognizing that each has a part in the problem and therefore should work to resolve it, they may blame their mate. They may even come to see separation or divorce as the solution. But is giving up on the marriage the answer?<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024322/1">b</a> Let us learn from a Bible character who persevered in an extremely difficult marriage.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[b]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> God’s Word discourages separation and makes clear that separation does not give either mate the right to remarry.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[61]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>The Bible example.</em></strong> The night before Jesus’ execution, the apostle Peter made a series of mistakes that led to the worst failure of his life. First, Peter displayed overconfidence, boasting that he would prove faithful even if the other apostles abandoned Jesus. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Mark 14:27-29</a>) Next, while in the garden of Gethsemane, Peter repeatedly failed to keep on the watch. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Mark 14:32,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 37-41</a>) Then, Peter abandoned Jesus to a mob. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Mark 14:50</a>) Finally, Peter denied knowing Jesus three times, even swearing to this lie with an oath. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Mark 14:66-71</a>) How did Peter react when he realized the gravity of his sin? He broke down and wept bitterly, perhaps feeling devastated by guilt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mark 14:72</a>) Just imagine Peter’s anguish when hours later his friend Jesus was executed.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[63]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Peter was able to persevere in serving Jehovah for several reasons. He did not isolate himself; he went to his spiritual brothers and no doubt was comforted by them.

He says: “Once I took that step, I immediately felt Jehovah’s loving hand expressed through them. The elders did not give up on me.

With Jehovah’s help, we <strong><em>can</em></strong> persevere despite disappointments. We can cultivate love for our brothers and sisters and forgive them even if they offend us. We can show the depth of our love for God and our respect for his arrangements by doing whatever we can to resolve problems that may arise in our marriage. And if we commit a sin, we can seek Jehovah’s help, accept his love and forgiveness, and keep moving forward in his service. We can be sure that we will reap rich blessings if we do “not give up in doing what is fine.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024322/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Gal. 6:9</a>.</p>
