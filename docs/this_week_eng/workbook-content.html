Thus, Jesus was saying that our main concern in life should not be the accumulation of material riches or the enjoyment of what we may possess. Instead, we should use our resources in such a way as to enrich, or build up, our relationship with Jehovah. Doing so will surely make us rich toward God. Why? Because it opens the door to many blessings from him. The Bible tells us: “The blessing of Jehovah​—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007567/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>.</p>

<strong>[<em>w95</em> 1/1 9 ¶19]</strong> <br/><strong>Triumphing Over Satan and His Works</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> It is of interest that God’s servant Job had to contend with “disquieting thoughts” that Satan conveyed through Eliphaz and Zophar. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Job 4:13-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 20:2, 3</a>) Job thus suffered “vexation,” resulting in his indulging in “wild talk” about the “terrors” afflicting his mind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job 6:2-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 30:15, 16</a>) Elihu listened quietly to Job and sincerely helped him see Jehovah’s all-wise view of matters. Likewise today, understanding elders show that they care for afflicted ones by not adding more “pressure” to such ones. Rather, like Elihu, they patiently listen to them and then apply the soothing oil of God’s Word. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 33:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> James 5:13-15</a>) Thus anyone whose emotions are disturbed by traumas, real or fancied, or who is “terrified . . . with dreams, and by visions” as Job was, may find soothing Scriptural comfort within the congregation.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Job 7:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995001/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> James 4:7</a>.</p>

<strong>[<em>g</em> 5/09 12-13]</strong> <br/>	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><strong>The Bible’s Viewpoint</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Does God Want You to Be Rich?</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“It’s a new day God has given me! I’m on my way to a six-figure income!”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa">“I’m dreaming big​—because all of heaven is dreaming big.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sa">“God gives us power to get wealth.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sa">“I’m prospering because of the Book [the Bible].”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">THESE statements reflect the view of a number of religious groups that attribute material wealth to the blessing of God. If you do the right thing by God, they preach, he will empower you to gain the good things of <em>this</em> life and reward you afterward as well. The theology has wide appeal, and books promoting it are best sellers. But does this “prosperity theology” harmonize with the Bible?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">To be sure, our Creator, whom the Bible calls “the happy God,” wants us to lead happy, successful lives. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Psalm 1:1-3</a>) Moreover, he blesses those who please him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>) But for us today, is that blessing merely a form of material prosperity? The answer becomes clear when we understand where we are in the stream of time according to God’s purpose.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>A Time to Get Rich?</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In the past, Jehovah God blessed some of his servants with material wealth, the patriarch Job and King Solomon being good examples of that. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Kings 10:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Job 42:12</a>) Yet, many other God-fearing men had little, including John the Baptist and Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 1:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Luke 9:58</a>) The point? According to the Bible, God deals with his servants in harmony with his purpose for them at the time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>) How does that principle apply to us today?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bible prophecy reveals that we are living in “the conclusion of the system of things,” or “the last days” of the present world. This era would be marked by warfare, disease, famines, earthquakes, and a breakdown in society​—conditions that have plagued mankind on an unprecedented scale since the year 1914. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Luke 21:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Revelation 6:3-8</a>) In short, this world, like a foundering ship, is about to sink! In view of those facts, would it make sense for God to bless each of his servants with material riches, or would God have other priorities for us?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jesus Christ compared our time with the days of Noah. Jesus said: “As they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>the ark; and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 24:37-39</a>) Jesus also compared our days with the days of Lot. Lot’s neighbors in Sodom and Gomorrah were ‘eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building.’ “But on the day that Lot came out of Sodom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all,” Jesus said, adding: “The same way it will be on that day when the Son of man is to be revealed.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 17:28-30</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To be sure, there is nothing wrong with eating, drinking, marrying, buying, and selling. The danger lies in being so absorbed in those things that we take no note of the urgency of the times. So ask yourself, ‘Would God be doing us a favor if he were to bless us with the very things that would fill our lives with distractions?’<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/102009167/0">a</a> On the contrary, he would be doing us a great disservice. That is not the way of the God of love!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>A Time to Save Lives!</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">At this critical time in human history, God’s people have an urgent work to do. Jesus said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses take those words very seriously. Hence, they encourage their neighbors to learn about that Kingdom and God’s requirements for everlasting life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">However, God does not expect his faithful servants to be ascetics. Rather, he wants them to be content with life’s necessities so that they can focus on serving him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>) He, in turn, will see that their material needs are filled. Says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:5</a>: “Let your manner of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things. For [God] has said: ‘I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you.’”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">God will prove true to those words in an outstanding way when he preserves “a great crowd” of true worshippers through the end of the present system of things and into a new world of peace and true prosperity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Jesus said: “I have come that they [his faithful followers] might have life and might have it in abundance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 10:10</a>) That ‘abundant life’ refers, not to a life of material plenty now, but to endless life in Paradise under God’s Kingdom rule.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Do not settle for less by being deceived by so-called prosperity theology, which, in reality, is distraction theology. Instead, heed Jesus’ loving but urgent words: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 21:34, 35</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sf"><strong>[Footnote]</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="se"><strong>HAVE YOU WONDERED?</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="su">◼ For what is it now the appointed time?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="su">◼ Jesus compared our time with the times of what Bible characters?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 24:37-39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Luke 17:28-30</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="su">◼ What must we avoid if we want to gain everlasting life?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009167/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 21:34</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="se"><strong>[Blurb on page 13]</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> So-called prosperity theology is, in reality, distraction theology</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"></p>

<strong>[<em>bt</em> chap. 2 ¶16-23]</strong> <br/><strong>“You Will Be Witnesses of Me”</strong><br/><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> It is little wonder that the apostles “returned to Jerusalem with great joy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 24:52</a>) How, though, would they respond to Christ’s guidance and instruction? In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">verses 13 and 14 of Acts chapter 1</a>, we find them gathered in an “upper room” and we learn some interesting details about such gatherings. Houses in Palestine at that time often had an upstairs room, accessible by an outside stairway. Might this “upper room” have been atop the house mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 12:12</a>, which belonged to the mother of Mark? At any rate, it was likely a simple, functional place for Christ’s followers to gather. But who gathered, and what did they do?</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Notice that the gathering was not limited to the apostles, nor just to men. “Some women” were there, including Jesus’ mother, Mary. This is the last direct mention of her in the Bible. It is fitting to think of her in that setting, not seeking prominence, but humbly gathering to worship with her spiritual brothers and sisters. It must have been a comfort to her that her four other sons, who had not been believers during Jesus’ lifetime, were now with her. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 13:55;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> John 7:5</a>) Since their half brother’s death and resurrection, they were changed men.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:7</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Note, too, why these disciples gathered: “With one purpose all of these were persisting in prayer.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 1:14</a>) Gathering together has always been essential to Christian worship. We gather to encourage one another, to receive instruction and counsel and, above all, to join in worship of our heavenly Father, Jehovah. Our prayers and songs of praise at such times are very pleasing to him and vital for us. May we never forsake these sacred and upbuilding gatherings!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">19-21. (a) What do we learn from the active role that Peter played in the congregation? (b) Why did Judas need to be replaced, and what can we learn from the way the matter was handled?</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Those followers of Christ now faced an important organizational need, and the apostle Peter took the lead in addressing it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Verses 15-26</a>) Is it not comforting to note how far Peter had come in the weeks since he had three times denied his Lord? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mark 14:72</a>) We are all prone to sin, and we need reminders that Jehovah is “good and ready to forgive” those who sincerely repent.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Peter perceived that Judas, the apostle who had betrayed Jesus, should be replaced. But by whom? The new apostle should be one who had followed Jesus throughout his ministry and had witnessed his resurrection. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 1:21, 22</a>) That was in harmony with Jesus’ own promise: <em>“You who have followed me</em> will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 19:28</a>) Jehovah evidently purposed to have 12 apostles who followed Jesus during his earthly ministry form the future “12 foundation stones” of New Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Rev. 21:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 14</a>) God thus allowed Peter to see that the prophecy, “his office of oversight let someone else take,” applied to Judas.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 109:8</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> How was the selection made? By casting lots, a common practice in Bible times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Prov. 16:33</a>) However, this is the last time that the Bible shows lots being used in this way. Evidently, the later outpouring of holy spirit rendered that method obsolete. Note, though, <em>why</em> lots were used. The apostles prayed: “You, O Jehovah, who know the hearts of all, designate which one of these two men you have chosen.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 1:23, 24</a>) They wanted the choice to be Jehovah’s. Matthias, likely one of the 70 disciples whom Jesus had sent out to preach, was chosen. Thus, Matthias became one of “the Twelve.”<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009043/2">c</a>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Acts 6:2</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">22, 23. Why should we be submissive and obedient to those taking the lead in the congregation today?</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong></span> This incident reminds us of the importance of organization among God’s people. To this day, responsible men are selected to serve as overseers in the congregation. The elders carefully consider the Scriptural qualifications required of such overseers, and they pray for the guidance of holy spirit. The congregation thus views such men as appointed by holy spirit. For our part, we remain submissive and obedient to their lead, promoting a cooperative spirit in the congregation.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009043/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Heb. 13:17</a>.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/bt/2022/29" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/bt/2022/28" alt="A body of elders meeting together." width="450" height="232" class="south_center" />
