<strong>[<em>w18.08</em> 22 ¶16-18]</strong> <br/><strong>Generous Givers Are Happy People</strong><br/><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>16.</strong><strong> What should motivate our acts of generosity?</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Truly generous people do not give in order to get something in return. Jesus had this in mind when he taught: “When you spread a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; and you will be happy, because they have nothing with which to repay you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018521/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 14:13, 14</a>) “The generous person will be blessed,” said one inspired writer. Another said: “Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018521/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Prov. 22:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018521/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ps. 41:1</a>) Indeed, we should give because we derive pleasure from helping others.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>17.</strong><strong> What kinds of giving will make you happy?</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> When Paul quoted Jesus’ words “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving,” Paul was referring not only to sharing material things but also to giving encouragement, guidance, and assistance to those in need of these. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018521/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 20:31-35</a>) By word and example, the apostle taught us to give of ourselves​—our time, our energy, our attention, our love.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>18.</strong><strong> What have many secular writers concluded with regard to generosity?</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Researchers in the field of social sciences have also observed that giving makes people happy. According to one article, “people report a significant happiness boost after doing kind deeds for others.” Helping others, researchers say, is important to developing “a greater sense of purpose and meaning” in life “because it fulfills basic human needs.” Hence, experts often recommend that people volunteer for public service to enhance their own health and happiness. This comes as no surprise to those who accept the Bible as the Word of mankind’s loving Designer, Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018521/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>.</p>

King David wrote: “Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one; Jehovah will rescue him in the day of calamity. Jehovah will guard him and keep him alive.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>) We know that an individual living in David’s day who showed consideration to a lowly one did not keep living without end. Hence, David could not have meant that such a considerate individual would be kept alive miraculously, thus gaining everlasting life. We can take those inspired words to mean that God would help the loyal considerate one. How? David explained: “Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed; during his sickness you will completely change his bed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) Yes, an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one could be certain that God was aware of him and his faithful course. And the recuperative power of his God-given body might help him to get better, to recover from his sickness.</p>

<strong>[<em>it</em>-2 16]</strong> <br/><strong>Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p81" data-pid="81">The entire Bible account revolves around the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty, and this makes manifest Jehovah God’s primary purpose: the sanctification of his own name. Such sanctification calls for the clearing of God’s name of all reproach. But, much more than that, it requires the honoring of that name as sacred by all intelligent creatures in heaven and on earth. This, in turn, means their recognizing and respecting Jehovah’s sovereign position, doing so willingly, wanting to serve him, delighting to do his divine will, because of love for him. David’s prayer to Jehovah at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/151/0" data-bid="152-1" class="b">Psalm 40:5-10</a> well expresses such attitude <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>and true sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Note the apostle’s application of portions of this psalm to Christ Jesus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/152/0" data-bid="153-1" class="b">Heb 10:5-10</a>.)</p>

However, a number of our brothers and sisters face a real challenge. They want to participate in the meetings, but fear prevents them. How can they cope with that fear? And what practical tips can help all of us to give encouraging comments? Before we answer those questions, let us first review four basic reasons why we comment at meetings.</p><h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>WHY WE COMMENT AT MEETINGS</strong></h2><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>3-5.</strong><strong> (a) As explained at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15</a>, why do we comment at meetings? (b) Must we all give the same type of comment? Explain.</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> <strong>Jehovah has given all of us the privilege to praise him.</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 119:108</a>) Our comments at meetings are part of our “sacrifice of praise,” and no one can offer that sacrifice for us. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 13:15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Does Jehovah demand <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>the same type of sacrifice, or comment, from each of us? No, he does not!</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Jehovah knows that we have different abilities and circumstances, and he deeply appreciates the sacrifices we are able to offer to him. Think of the type of sacrifices that he accepted from the Israelites. Some Israelites were able to offer a lamb or a goat. But a poor Israelite might offer “two turtledoves or two young pigeons.” And if an Israelite could not afford two birds, Jehovah accepted “a tenth of an ephah of fine flour.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 5:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Flour was less expensive, but Jehovah still appreciated that sacrifice, as long as it was “fine flour.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Our kind God feels the same way today. When we give comments, he does not demand that all of us be as eloquent as Apollos or as persuasive as Paul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 18:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 26:28</a>) All Jehovah wants is that we give the best comments we can​—within our limits. Remember the widow who offered the two small coins. She was precious to Jehovah because she gave the best she could.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 21:1-4</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;<img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w19/2019/15" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w19/2019/14" alt="A congregation praising Jehovah by commenting at a meeting" width="113" height="56" class="north_center" />

We enjoy the simple, sincere words of a young child. We are inspired by the excitement in the voice of someone who is commenting about a truth that he or she has just discovered. And we admire those who “mustered up courage” to give a comment, even though they are shy or are only beginning to learn our language.

We can thank them for their encouraging comment after the meeting. Another way is by giving a comment ourselves. Then not only do we receive encouragement at our meetings but we also give it.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 1:11, 12</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

First, if we <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>plan to give a comment, we are especially motivated to prepare well for the meeting. When we prepare well, we gain a deeper understanding of God’s Word. And the deeper our understanding, the better we can apply the things we learn. Second, we will likely enjoy the meeting more because we are involved in the discussion. Third, because it takes effort to comment, we often remember the points we spoke about long after the meeting ends.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Still, some may be afraid to raise their hand. If that is how you feel, do not be discouraged. Let us consider some Bible principles, a few examples, and some practical tips that can help all of us to try to comment more at meetings.</p><h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>COPING WITH FEAR</strong></h2><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong><strong> (a) What fear do many of us have? (b) Why might having a fear of answering be a good sign?</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Do you get a knot in your stomach each time you even think of raising your hand to comment? If so, you are not alone. The truth is that most of us feel some fear when we comment. Before you can cope with this crippling feeling, you need to identify the cause of your fear. Are you afraid that you will forget what you want to say or that you will say the wrong thing? Do you worry that your comment will not be as good as <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>the comments of others? Actually, those fears can be a good sign. They indicate that you are humble and view others as superior to you. Jehovah loves that quality. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 138:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:3</a>) But Jehovah also wants you to praise him and to encourage your brothers and sisters at the meetings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:11</a>) He loves you and will give you the courage you need.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong><strong> What Scriptural reminders can help us?</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Consider some Scriptural reminders. The Bible says that all of us make mistakes in what we say and how we say it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2</a>) Jehovah does not expect us to be perfect, and neither do our brothers and sisters. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 103:12-14</a>) They are our spiritual family, and they love us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mark 10:29, 30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> John 13:35</a>) They understand that our comments at times do not come out exactly right.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>12-13.</strong><strong> What do we learn from the examples of Nehemiah and Jonah?</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Think about some Bible examples that can help you to cope with your fears. Remember Nehemiah. He served in the court of a powerful king. Nehemiah was gloomy because he had heard that the walls and gates of Jerusalem were in ruins. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1-4</a>) Imagine the knot he might have had in his stomach when the king asked him to explain why he was looking so unhappy! Nehemiah quickly prayed and then gave his answer. In response, the king did much to help God’s people. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1-8</a>) Think, too, of Jonah. When Jehovah asked him to speak to the inhabitants of Nineveh, Jonah was so scared that he ran in the opposite direction. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jonah 1:1-3</a>) But with Jehovah’s help, Jonah carried out his assignment. And the words he spoke did much good for those in Nineveh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jonah 3:5-10</a>) From Nehemiah we learn the importance of praying before we answer. And from Jonah we learn that Jehovah can help us to serve him despite our greatest fears. Realistically, is any congregation going to be as intimidating as the Ninevites?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> What practical tips can help you to give encouraging comments at the meetings?

<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong><strong> Why should we prepare well for our meetings, and when might we do so?</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> <strong>Prepare for each meeting.</strong> When you plan ahead and prepare well, you will feel more confident about commenting. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5</a>) Of course, we do not all have the same routine. Eloise, a widow in her 80’s, begins preparing for the <em>Watchtower</em> Study early in the week. She says, “I enjoy the meetings more if I study in advance.” Joy, who works secularly full-time, sets aside time on Saturday to study <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>her <em>Watchtower.</em> “I like to have the material fresh in mind,” she says. Ike, a busy elder who is also a pioneer, says, “I find that it is best for me to study for short periods of time throughout the week rather than in one large chunk of time.”</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>15.</strong><strong> How can you prepare well for a meeting?</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> What is involved in preparing well for the meeting?

Analyze the title, subheadings, illustrations, and teaching boxes. As you now study each paragraph, read as many of the cited scriptures as you can. Meditate on the information, giving special attention to points you wish to comment on. The better you prepare, the more you will benefit and the easier it may be for you to comment.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:6</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

The <em>JW Library</em><sup>®</sup> app enables us to download study publications onto a mobile device. Then we can study​—or at least read or listen to the material—​anytime and anywhere. Some use this tool to study during a lunch break at work or at school or while traveling.

Because you may not always be called on when you raise your hand. Others will likely raise their hand at the same time, and the conductor might choose one of them. In order to keep the meeting on schedule, the conductor may have to limit the number of comments on any given point. So do not be offended or discouraged if he does not call on you early in the study. If you prepare several comments, you will have more opportunities to share in the discussion. One of the comments you prepare could involve reading a scripture. But if you can, also prepare to give a comment, using your own words.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2019241/1">b</a></p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>18.</strong><strong> Why give brief comments?</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> <strong>Give brief comments.</strong> Often, the <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>most encouraging comments are short and simple. So aim at keeping your answers brief. Try limiting them to about 30 seconds. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Prov. 10:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 15:23</a>) If you have been answering at meetings for many years, you have an important role to play​—setting a good example by keeping your comments brief. If you give complex comments that last several minutes, others may feel intimidated, thinking that they will not be able to match your ability at answering. Also, brief comments allow time for more people to participate in the meeting. Especially if you are called on first, give a simple, direct answer to the question. Do not try to cover all the points in a paragraph. After the main idea of the paragraph has been discussed, you may comment on supplementary points.​—See the box “<a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2019241#h=54-62:0">What Can I Comment On?</a>”</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>19.</strong><strong> How can the conductor help you, but what will you have to do?</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> <strong>Let the conductor know that you would like to comment on a specific paragraph.</strong> If you choose to do this, you should approach the conductor well before the meeting begins. When it is time to comment on that paragraph, put your hand up quickly and high enough so that the conductor can see it.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>20.</strong><strong> How is a congregation meeting like a meal shared with friends?</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> View the congregation meetings like a meal shared with good friends. Imagine that some friends in the congregation planned a barbecue and asked you to prepare some small item of food. How would you respond? You might feel a little anxious, but you would likely do your best to bring something that everyone could enjoy. Jehovah, our Host, has provided a table full of good things for us at our meetings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 23:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019241/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:45</a>) And he is pleased when we bring a simple gift, the best that we can give. So prepare well and participate as freely as you can. Then you will not only feed at Jehovah’s table but also bring a gift to share with the congregation.</p>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> KING HEROD AGRIPPA I</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Herod Agrippa I, who had James executed and Peter imprisoned, was the grandson of Herod the Great. The Herods were a dynasty of political rulers over the Jews. The family was Idumaean, that is, Edomite. The Idumaeans were nominally Jewish, since circumcision had been forced upon them in about 125 B.C.E.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Born in 10 B.C.E., Herod Agrippa I was educated in Rome. He cultivated friendships with various members of the imperial family. One of those friends was Gaius, better known as Caligula, who became emperor in 37 C.E. He soon proclaimed Agrippa king over Ituraea, Trachonitis, and Abilene. Later, Caligula expanded Agrippa’s domain to include Galilee and Perea.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Agrippa was in Rome when Caligula was assassinated in 41 C.E. Reportedly, Agrippa played an important role in resolving the crisis that ensued. He participated in the tense negotiations between another powerful friend, Claudius, and the Roman Senate. The result was that Claudius was proclaimed emperor and civil war was averted. To reward Agrippa for his mediation, Claudius granted him kingship also over Judea and Samaria, which had been administered by Roman procurators since 6 C.E. Thus Agrippa came to be in charge of territories equaling those of Herod the Great.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Agrippa’s capital was Jerusalem, where he won the favor of the religious leaders. He is said to have observed Jewish law and traditions scrupulously by, among other things, offering sacrifices in the temple daily, reading the Law publicly, and playing “the role of zealous protector of the Jewish faith.” However, he belied his claim of being a worshipper of God by arranging gladiatorial combats and pagan spectacles in the theater. Agrippa’s character has been described as “treacherous, superficial, extravagant.”</p>
