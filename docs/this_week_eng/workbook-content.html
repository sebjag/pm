We might find ourselves in a similar situation one day. Before entering the Promised Land, the Israelites, who had been poor and weak in the land of Egypt, were reminded that they should not “harden [their] heart” toward their afflicted brothers. Jehovah expected them to consider the poor as being worthy of help.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014447/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 15:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014447/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014447/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Lev. 25:35-38</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014447/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 33:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014447/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Matt. 7:1</a>) To illustrate: When a motorcyclist injured in a traffic mishap arrives at the emergency ward, do those on the medical team try to determine whether he caused the accident? No, they immediately provide the needed medical assistance. Similarly, if a fellow believer has been weakened by personal problems, our priority should be to provide spiritual assistance.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014447/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:14</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;

Think of sisters who have been enduring family opposition for years. Some may be of humble appearance and look fragile, yet do they not demonstrate outstanding faith and inner strength? When you see a single mother regularly coming to meetings with her child or children, are you not impressed by her faith and determination? And what of teenagers who stick to the truth despite the bad influences in school? In all modesty, we recognize that such ones, who may seem to be weaker, may be as “rich in faith” as those among us who have more favorable circumstances.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014447/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jas. 2:5</a>.</p>

He listened as Job and the three other men spoke. He obviously paid close attention to what was said because he was able to give some compassionate but direct counsel that helped Job correct his thinking. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 33:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 17</a>) Elihu’s main concern was to exalt Jehovah, not himself or any other man. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Job 32:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 37:23, 24</a>) From Elihu’s example we learn that there is a time to keep silent and listen. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Jas. 1:19</a>) We also learn that when we do give counsel, our primary interest should be to bring honor to Jehovah, not to ourselves.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Wise King Solomon was inspired to write: “Like apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Prov. 25:11</a>) When we listen carefully to what others say and we think before we speak, our words can be like those apples of gold​—both valuable and beautiful. Then, whether we say a little or a lot, our speech will build others up, and we will make Jehovah proud of us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Prov. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020327/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:29</a>) What better way could we express our appreciation for this gift from God!</p>

But we need not try too hard to erase all signs of aging. Those signs can be evidence of maturity, dignity, and inner beauty. For example, the Bible says: “Gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 16:31</a>) That is how Jehovah views us, and we should try to view ourselves as he does. <strong>(<em>Read</em></strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong><em>1 Peter 3:3, 4</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>)</strong> Is it wise, therefore, to risk unnecessary and potentially dangerous surgical procedures or medical treatments merely to make oneself more physically attractive? “The joy of Jehovah” is a source of true beauty that radiates from the inside, regardless of age or health. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 8:10</a>) Only in the new world will we be completely healthy and regain youthful beauty.

Immediately afterward, at Jesus’ direction, Peter hauled in a miraculous catch of fish. Peter fell to his knees in fear, but Jesus said to him: “Stop being afraid.

When Jesus’ enemies arrested him, courage moved Peter to defend Jesus with the sword and later to follow him right into the courtyard of the high priest. Yet, not long afterward, Peter denied his Master three times and then wept bitterly when he realized what he had done.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Matt. 26:31-35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/56/1" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> 51, 52,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/56/2" data-bid="57-3" class="b"> 69-75</a>.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Shortly before Jesus’ first post-resurrection appearance to his apostles in Galilee, Peter announced that he was going fishing, and other apostles joined him. On recognizing Jesus on the beach, Peter impulsively plunged into the water and swam ashore. At the breakfast of fish that Jesus cooked for his apostles, Jesus asked Peter if he loved him more than “these”​—that is, the fish that were before them. Jesus was urging Peter to choose to follow him full-time rather than pursue a career, such as the fishing business.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">John 21:1-22</a>.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> In about 62-64 C.E., Peter preached the good news in Babylon, in modern-day Iraq, where there was a large Jewish population.

John’s family appears to have been materially prosperous. Zebedee’s fishing business was large enough to have hired men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Mark 1:20</a>) Salome accompanied Jesus, ministered to him when he was in Galilee, and later brought spices to prepare Jesus’ body for burial.

<br/><strong>Picture description:</strong> The apostle John holding a scroll.
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> John was likely the disciple of John the Baptizer who was standing with Andrew when John the Baptizer looked at Jesus and said: “See, the Lamb of God!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">John 1:35, 36,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/64/1" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> 40</a>) Following this introduction, John the son of Zebedee evidently accompanied Jesus to Cana and was an eyewitness to Jesus’ first miracle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">John 2:1-11</a>) The vividness and detail with which John describes Jesus’ subsequent activity in Jerusalem, Samaria, and Galilee suggest that the Gospel writer may also have witnessed these events. The readiness with which John​—like James, Peter, and Andrew—​abandoned his fishing nets, boat, and livelihood when called by Jesus to be his follower testifies to John’s faith.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Matt. 4:18-22</a>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> John does not appear as prominently as Peter does in the Gospel accounts. However, John too had a vigorous personality, as evidenced by the surname that Jesus gave to him and his brother James​—Boanerges, meaning “Sons of Thunder.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Mark 3:17</a>) Initially, John was ambitious for prominence, so much so that he and his brother got their mother to ask Jesus to give her sons privileged positions in his Kingdom. While this desire was selfish, it was also evidence of their faith in the reality of the Kingdom. The brothers’ ambition gave Jesus occasion to admonish all his apostles regarding the need for humility.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Matt. 20:20-28</a>.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> John manifested his strong character when he tried to prevent a certain man who was not a follower of Jesus from expelling demons in his name. On another occasion, John was ready to call down fire from heaven to destroy the inhabitants of a Samaritan village who were unresponsive when Jesus sent messengers to make some preparations for him. For these reactions, Jesus rebuked John. Evidently, as time went by, John developed the balance and mercy that he once seemed to lack. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Luke 9:49-56</a>) Despite his shortcomings, however, John was “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” Thus, when Jesus was about to die, he entrusted his own mother, Mary, to John’s care.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">John 19:26, 27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 21:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/70/2" data-bid="71-3" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/70/3" data-bid="71-4" class="b"> 24</a>.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> John outlived the other apostles, just as Jesus had prophesied that he would. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">John 21:20-22</a>) John served Jehovah faithfully for some 70 years. Toward the end of his life, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Domitian, John was exiled to the island of Patmos “for speaking about God and bearing witness concerning Jesus.” There, in about 96 C.E., John received the visions that he recorded in the book of Revelation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Rev. 1:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Tradition has it that after his release, John went to Ephesus, where he penned the Gospel that bears his name and the letters known as 1, 2, and 3 John, and that he died in Ephesus in about 100 C.E.</p>
