It is not a community association or a club where people with a similar background or similar interests in a sport or a hobby come together.

At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007285/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 35:18</a>, we read: “I will laud you in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you.” Similarly, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007285/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 107:31, 32</a> encourages us: “O let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness and for his wonderful works to the sons of men.

<strong>[<em>it</em>-2 420 ¶4]</strong> <br/><strong>Moab</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Later, when David himself ruled as king, there also was warfare between Israel and Moab. The Moabites were completely subdued and were made to pay tribute to David. Apparently at the end of the conflict two thirds of Moab’s fighting men were put to death. It seems that David had them lie down on the ground in a row and then measured this row to determine the two thirds to be put to death and the one third to be preserved alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2Sa 8:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 1Ch 18:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/3" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> 11</a>) Possibly in the course of the same conflict, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada “struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Sa 23:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 1Ch 11:22</a>) David’s decisive victory over the Moabites was a fulfillment of Balaam’s prophetic words uttered over 400 years earlier: “A star will certainly step forth out of Jacob, and a scepter will indeed rise out of Israel. And he will certainly break apart the temples of Moab’s head and the cranium of all the sons of tumult of war.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Nu 24:17</a>) Also apparently with reference to this victory, the psalmist spoke of God’s regarding Moab as his “washing pot.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 60:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 108:9</a>.</p>

<strong>[<em>bt</em> chap. 18 ¶6-15]</strong> <br/><strong>“Seek God, . . . and Really Find Him”</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> How did the Greek intellectuals react to Paul’s teaching? Some used a word that means “chatterer,” or “seed picker.” (See study note on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 17:18</a>, <em>nwtsty.</em>) Regarding this Greek term, one scholar states: “The word was originally used of a small bird that went around picking up grain, and later was applied to persons who picked up food scraps and other odds and ends in the market place. Still later it came to be used figuratively of any person who picked up odd bits of information, and especially of one who was unable to put them together properly.” In effect, those learned men were saying that Paul was an ignorant plagiarist. Yet, as we will see, Paul was not intimidated by such name-calling.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> It is no different today. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we have often been the target of name-calling because of our Bible-based beliefs. For example, some educators teach that evolution is a fact and insist that if you are intelligent, you must accept it. They, in effect, label as ignorant those who refuse to believe in it. Such learned men would have people think that we are ‘seed pickers’ when we present what the Bible says and point to the evidence of design in nature. But we are not intimidated. On the contrary, we speak with confidence when defending our belief that life on earth is the product of an intelligent Designer, Jehovah God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 8.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 17:18</a>) Was Paul really introducing new gods to the Athenians? This was a serious matter, echoing one of the charges for which <span id="page142" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="142" data-before-text="142"></span>Socrates had been tried and condemned to death centuries earlier. Not surprisingly, Paul was led to the Areopagus and asked to explain the teachings that sounded strange to the Athenians.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009062/2">c</a> How would Paul defend his message to individuals who had no background in the Scriptures?</p>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> EPICUREANS AND STOICS</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> The Epicureans and Stoics were followers of two separate schools of philosophy. Neither believed in a resurrection.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> The Epicureans believed in the existence of gods but thought that the gods had no interest in men and would neither reward nor punish them, so prayer or sacrifice was useless. Epicureans held pleasure to be the supreme good in life. Their thinking and actions were devoid of moral principle. Moderation was urged, however, on the grounds that it prevented the negative consequences of overindulgence. Knowledge was sought only to rid a person of religious fears and superstition.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> The Stoics, on the other hand, believed that all things were part of an impersonal deity and that the human soul emanated from such a source. Some Stoics held that the soul would eventually be destroyed along with the universe. Other Stoics believed that the soul would ultimately be reabsorbed by this deity. According to Stoic philosophers, happiness was to be obtained by following nature.</p><h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>“Men of Athens, I See” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 17:22, 23</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h2><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">9-11. (a) How did Paul endeavor to establish common ground with his audience? (b) How can we imitate Paul’s example in our ministry?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Recall that Paul was greatly disturbed by all the idolatry he had seen. Rather than unleash an unbridled attack on idol worship, however, he maintained his composure. With the utmost tact, he endeavored to win over his audience by establishing common ground. He began: “Men of Athens, I see that in all things you seem to be more given <span id="page143" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="143" data-before-text="143"></span>to the fear of the deities than others are.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 17:22</a>) In a sense, Paul was saying, ‘I see that you are very religious.’ Wisely, Paul commended them for being religiously inclined. He recognized that some who are blinded by false beliefs may have receptive hearts. After all, Paul knew that he himself had once “acted in ignorance and with a lack of faith.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:13</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Building on common ground, Paul mentioned that he had observed tangible evidence of the Athenians’ religiousness​—an altar dedicated “To an Unknown God.” According to one source, “it was customary for Greeks and others to dedicate altars to ‘unknown gods,’ for fear that in their worship they had omitted some god who might otherwise be offended.” By means of such an altar, the Athenians admitted the existence of a God who was unknown to them. Paul used the presence of this altar to make a transition into the good news that he was preaching. He explained: “What you are unknowingly worshipping, this I am declaring to you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 17:23</a>) Paul’s reasoning was subtle but powerful. He was not preaching a new or strange god, as some had charged. He was explaining the God that was unknown to them​—the true God.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> How can we imitate Paul’s example in our ministry? If we are observant, we may see evidence that a person is religiously devout, perhaps by noting some religious item that he is wearing or that is displayed on his home or in the yard. We might say: ‘I see that you are a religious person. I was hoping to talk to someone who is religiously inclined.’ By tactfully acknowledging the person’s religious feelings, we may establish common ground on which to build. Remember that it is not our aim to prejudge others based on their religious convictions. Among our fellow worshippers are many who at one time sincerely embraced false religious beliefs.</p><br/>&nbsp;<img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/bt/2022/221" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/bt/2022/220" alt="A teenage boy speaking to his teacher and classmates in science class." width="113" height="63" class="south_center" />

Knowing that his listeners were educated in Greek philosophy and unfamiliar with the Scriptures, he adapted his approach in several ways. First, he presented Biblical teachings without directly quoting from the Scriptures. Second, he identified himself with his listeners, at times using the words “us” and “we.” Third, he quoted from Greek literature to show that certain things he was teaching were expressed in their own writings. Let us now examine Paul’s powerful speech. What important truths did he convey about the God who was unknown to the Athenians?</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">13.

However, some of the Greek philosophers in Paul’s audience may have believed that a god would need nothing from humans. If so, they no doubt agreed with Paul’s statement that God is not “served by human hands as if he needed anything.” Indeed, there is nothing material that humans can give to the Creator! Rather, he gives humans what they need​—“life and breath and all things,” including the sun, the rain, and fruitful soil. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 17:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009062/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Gen. 2:7</a>) So God, the Giver, is not dependent on humans, the receivers.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">15.

How could any of Paul’s listeners miss the point? We learn an important lesson from his example. While we want to be tactful and reasonable in our witnessing work, we do not want to water down Bible truth so as to make it more acceptable to others.</p>
