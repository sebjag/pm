<div class="padding"><strong>[<em>w05</em> 9/15 27 ¶1-3]</strong> <br/><strong>Resist Wrong Thinking!</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Closely related to the idea that God is too exacting is the view that he regards humans as useless. Eliphaz’ third speech contains the question: “Can an able-bodied man be of use to God himself, that anyone having insight should be of use toward him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 22:2</a>) Eliphaz was implying that man is useless to God. In a similar vein, Bildad argued: “How can mortal man be in the right before God, or how can one born of a woman be clean?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 25:4</a>) According to that line of reasoning, how could Job, a mere mortal, ever presume to have a righteous standing before God?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Some people today are plagued with negative feelings about themselves. Such factors as family upbringing, exposure to the pressures of life, or being victims of racial or ethnic hatred may have contributed to this. But Satan and his demons also take delight in crushing a person. If they can influence an individual to feel that nothing he does is good enough for Almighty God, he is more vulnerable to despondency. In time, such a person could drift away, even draw away, from the living God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3:12</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Advancing age and health problems put limitations on us. The share we have in Kingdom service may seem quite small in comparison with what we did when we were younger, healthier, and stronger. How important it is to recognize that Satan and his demons want us to feel that what we do is not good enough for God! We must resist such thinking.</p>

<div class="padding"><strong>[<em>w95</em> 2/15 27 ¶6]</strong> <br/><strong>A Lesson in How to Handle Problems</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">His three companions further disheartened Job by voicing personal ideas rather than godly wisdom. Eliphaz went so far as to say that ‘God has no faith in his servants’ and that it did not really matter to Jehovah whether Job was righteous or not. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 4:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22:2, 3</a>) It is hard to imagine a more discouraging​—or more untruthful—​remark than that! Not surprisingly, Jehovah later rebuked Eliphaz and his companions for this blasphemy. “You men have not <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>spoken concerning me what is truthful,” he said. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) But the most damaging assertion was yet to come.</p>

In fact, speaking of mankind in general, Satan said to Jehovah: “Everything that a man [not just Job but anyone] has he will give in behalf of his soul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 2:4</a>) Do you see your role in this vital issue? As indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>, Jehovah is saying that there is something you can give to him​—a basis for him to make a reply to his taunter, Satan. Imagine​—the Universal Sovereign is calling upon you to share in addressing the greatest issue of all time. What an awesome responsibility and privilege is yours! Can you fulfill what Jehovah is asking of you? Job did. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 2:9, 10</a>) So did Jesus as well as countless others throughout history, including many youths. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Philippians 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Revelation 6:9</a>) You can do the same. Make no mistake about it, though, there is no neutral ground in this matter. By your course of action, you will <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>show that you support either Satan’s taunt or Jehovah’s reply. Which will you choose to uphold?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Jehovah Cares for You!</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11, 12. Does it make a difference to Jehovah whether you choose to serve him or not? Explain.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Does it really matter to Jehovah which choice you make? Have not enough people already remained faithful for him to give an adequate reply to Satan? True, the Devil asserted that no one serves Jehovah out of love, a charge that has already been proved false. Still, Jehovah wants you to take his side on the issue of sovereignty because he cares about you as an individual. Jesus said: “It is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 18:14</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Clearly, Jehovah is interested in the course you choose. More than that, he is affected by it. The Bible makes clear that Jehovah has deep feelings that are stirred by the good or the bad actions of humans. For example, when the Israelites repeatedly rebelled, Jehovah was “pained.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 78:40, 41</a>) Before the Deluge of Noah’s day, when “the badness of man was abundant,” Jehovah “felt hurt at his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Genesis 6:5, 6</a>) Think about what this means. If you adopted a wrong course, you could cause your Creator to feel pain. This does not mean that God is weak or is ruled by emotion. Rather, he loves you and cares about your welfare. On the other hand, when you do what is right, Jehovah’s heart rejoices. He is happy not only because he has a further reply to give to Satan but also because he can now become your Rewarder. And that is something he wants to become. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) What a loving Father you have in Jehovah God!</p>

<strong>[<em>w04</em> 7/15 21-22]</strong> <br/><strong>Use Spiritual Goals to Glorify Your Creator</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Consider how Jehovah accomplished the creation of the universe. With the words “there came to be evening and there came to be morning,” Jehovah marked off the successive periods of creation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 1:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/6/4" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/6/5" data-bid="7-6" class="b"> 31</a>) At the beginning of each creative time period, he well knew his goal, or objective, for that day. And God carried out his purpose to create things. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>) “[Jehovah’s] own soul has a desire, and he will do it,” said the patriarch Job. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 23:13</a>) How satisfying it must have been for Jehovah to see “everything he had made” and declare it “very good”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004525/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>For our goals to become a reality, we too must have a strong desire to achieve them. What will help us develop such an intense desire? Even while the earth was formless and waste, Jehovah could foresee the end result​—a beautiful jewel in space, bringing him glory and honor. Similarly, our desire to accomplish what we set out to do can be cultivated by meditating on the results and benefits of achieving the goal. That was the experience of 19-year-old Tony. He never forgot his first impression of a visit to a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Western Europe. From then on, the question that occupied Tony’s mind was, ‘What would it be like to live and serve in a place like that?’ Tony never stopped thinking about the possibility, and he continued to reach out for it.

Why? He knew how much the people needed to know the truth, and he wanted to give as many as possible an opportunity to accept the Kingdom message. He also knew that some who initially were indifferent would eventually respond. Consider what happened in his own family. During Jesus’ entire three-and-a-half-year ministry, none of his brothers became his disciples. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021404/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 7:5</a>) Yet, after his resurrection, they became Christians.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021404/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 1:14</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Even those who choose not to listen to us see our good conduct and positive attitude, and they may eventually begin to “glorify God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021404/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

But now there are 14 publishers here. Thirteen of them got baptized, including my wife and three children. We have an average of 32 people at the meetings.” Getahun is glad that he continued preaching while he patiently waited for Jehovah to draw honesthearted people to His organization!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021404/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

He gives us the privilege of working along with his Son in gathering people from all nations before the end of this system comes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021404/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hag. 2:7</a>) Our preaching work could be likened to a rescue mission. And we are like members of a rescue team sent to free people trapped in a mine. Although only a few miners may be found alive, the work done by all the rescuers is valuable. The same is true of the work we do in our ministry. We do not know how many people will yet be rescued from Satan’s system. But Jehovah can use any one of us to help them. Andreas, who lives in Bolivia, says, “I see each person who learns Bible truths and gets baptized as the result of a group effort.” May we maintain a similar positive attitude toward our ministry. If we do, Jehovah will bless us, and our ministry will be a real source of joy.</p>

<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> During the period of time covered by the book of Acts, Rome was the largest and politically the most important city in the then-known world. It was the capital of an empire that at its peak dominated lands stretching from Britain to North Africa and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Rome was a melting pot of cultures, races, languages, and superstitions. A network of well-maintained roads brought travelers and merchandise from every corner of the empire. At the nearby port of Ostia, ships that plied busy trade routes unloaded foodstuffs and luxury goods destined for the city.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> By the first century C.E., well over a million people lived in Rome. Perhaps half of the population were slaves​—condemned criminals, children sold or abandoned by their parents, and prisoners captured during campaigns by the Roman legions. Among those brought to Rome as slaves were Jews from Jerusalem, following the conquest of that city by Roman General Pompey in 63 B.C.E.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Most of the free population were paupers, who lived in crowded multistory housing and depended on government subsidies. The emperors, however, adorned their capital with some of the most magnificent public buildings ever seen. Among them were theaters and great stadiums that offered such spectacles as stage performances, gladiatorial contests, and chariot racing​—all free for the entertainment of the masses.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">6, 7.

Of course, it is a challenge to reach people of different languages. Yet, Jehovah’s Witnesses have produced Bible-based material in more than 1,000 languages. If you are actively associated with the Christian congregation and are sharing in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work, you have reason to rejoice.

<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> <em>The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ</em> (175 B.C.–A.D. 135) states: “In <em>Mesopotamia, Media</em> and <em>Babylonia</em> lived the descendants of members of the kingdom of the ten tribes [of Israel], and of the kingdom of Judah, once deported there by the Assyrians and the Babylonians.” According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezra 2:64</a>, only 42,360 Israelites returned to Jerusalem from their Babylonian exile. This took place in 537 B.C.E. Flavius Josephus remarks that in the first century C.E., the Jews who “dwelt about Babylonia” numbered into the tens of thousands. In the third to the fifth centuries C.E., these communities produced the work known as the Babylonian Talmud.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Documentary evidence exists of a Jewish presence in Egypt at least as early as the sixth century B.C.E. During that period, Jeremiah directed a message to Jews living in various localities of Egypt, including Memphis.

Josephus says that Jews were among the first settlers of Alexandria. In time, an entire section of this city was allotted to them.

Yet, as a nation they bore community responsibility for this act. Note, though, that Peter addressed his fellow Jews respectfully and appealed to their hearts. Peter’s goal was to move his listeners to repentance, not to condemn them. Did the crowd listening take offense at Peter’s words? By no means. Instead, the people were “stabbed to the heart.” They asked: “What should we do?” Peter’s positive approach likely played a role in his reaching the hearts of many, so that they were moved to repent.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 2:37</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> We can imitate Peter’s manner of appealing to hearts. When witnessing to others, we need not take issue with every unscriptural view that the householder may express. Rather, we would do well to build on points on which we can agree. If we establish common ground with our listener, we can then tactfully reason from God’s Word. Often, when Bible truths are presented in such a positive fashion, righthearted ones are more likely to respond favorably.</p>

Writing from Pontus in about 112 C.E., Pliny reported that the “contagion” of Christianity threatened everyone, regardless of gender, age, or rank. Pliny gave those accused of being Christians opportunity to deny it, and those who would not, he executed. Any who cursed Christ or recited a prayer to the gods or to Trajan’s statue were released.

Moreover, they were already demonstrating their zeal​—in some cases, by traveling great distances to be present at this annual festival.

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> CHRISTIANITY IN PONTUS</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Among those who heard Peter’s speech at Pentecost 33 C.E. were Jews from Pontus, a district of northern Asia Minor. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Acts 2:9</a>) Evidently, some of them took the good news back to their homeland, for those to whom Peter addressed his first letter included believers who were “scattered about” in such places as Pontus.<a id="footnotesource7" data-fnid="7" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009044/6">g</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:1</a>) His writing reveals that these Christians had been “distressed by various trials” because of their faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:6</a>) Likely, this included opposition and persecution.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Further tests faced by Christians in Pontus are alluded to in correspondence between Pliny the Younger, governor of the Roman province of Bithynia and Pontus, and Emperor Trajan. Writing from Pontus in about 112 C.E., Pliny reported that the “contagion” of Christianity threatened everyone, regardless of gender, age, or rank. Pliny gave those accused of being Christians opportunity to deny it, and those who would not, he executed. Any who cursed Christ or recited a prayer to the gods or to Trajan’s statue were released. Pliny acknowledged that these were things that “those who are really Christians cannot be made to do.”</p><br/>&nbsp;<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>“Let Each One of You Be Baptized” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 2:38-47</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h2><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">15. (a) What statement did Peter make, and what was the response? (b) Why could thousands who heard the good news at Pentecost qualify to be baptized on the same day?</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> On the thrilling day of Pentecost 33 C.E., Peter said to responsive Jews and proselytes: “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 2:38</a>) As a result, about 3,000 were baptized, likely in pools in or near Jerusalem.<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009044/4">e</a> Was this an impulsive act? Does this account serve as a precedent for Bible students and for children of Christian parents to rush into baptism before they are ready? Not at all. <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>Remember, those Jews and Jewish proselytes who were baptized on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E. were keen students of God’s Word, and they were part of a nation that had been dedicated to Jehovah. Moreover, they were already demonstrating their zeal​—in some cases, by traveling great distances to be present at this annual festival. After accepting the vital truths concerning Jesus Christ’s role in the outworking of God’s purpose, they were ready to continue serving God​—but now as baptized followers of <em>Christ.</em></p>
