<strong>[<em>w96</em> 12/1 29-30]</strong> <br/><strong>“Remember the Days Gone By”—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Sadly, the Israelites often yielded to the sin of forgetfulness. With what result? “Again and again they would put God to the test, and they pained even the Holy One of Israel. They did not remember his hand, the day that he redeemed them from the adversary.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996886/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 78:41, 42</a>) Eventually, their forgetfulness of Jehovah’s commands resulted in their being rejected by him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996886/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 21:42, 43</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>A fine example was set by the psalmist who wrote: “I shall remember the practices of Jah; for I will remember your marvelous doing of long ago. And I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996886/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 77:11, 12</a>) Such meditative calling to mind of past loyal service and Jehovah’s loving acts will provide for us needed motivation, encouragement, and appreciation. Also, “remembering the former days” can serve to dispel tiredness and can spur us on to do all we can and to faithful endurance.</p>

To overcome a tendency to complain, we need to keep these blessings uppermost in our mind. For instance, each of us has the wonderful privilege of bearing the personal name of Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006524/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10</a>) We can cultivate a close relationship with him, and we are able to speak to the “Hearer of prayer” at any time.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006524/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>) We can have a regular share in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006524/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) Faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ enables us to have a clean conscience. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006524/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) These are blessings we enjoy no matter what we have to endure.</p>

<strong>[<em>w11</em> 7/1 10 ¶3-4]</strong> <br/><strong>Does Jehovah Have Feelings?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The psalmist says: “How often they would rebel against him in the wilderness!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Verse 40</a>) The next verse adds: “Again and again they would put God to the test.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Verse 41</a>) Notice that the writer describes a pattern of rebellion. This ugly spirit surfaced early​—in the wilderness shortly after their deliverance from Egypt. The people began to murmur against God, questioning whether he was able and willing to care for them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Numbers 14:1-4</a>) A reference work for Bible translators says that the words “they would rebel against him” might be “rendered idiomatically as ‘they made their hearts hard against God’ or ‘they said “No” to God.’” Yet, in his mercy, Jehovah would forgive his people when they demonstrated repentance. But then they would return to their old ways and rebel again, and the pattern continued.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 78:10-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 38</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How did Jehovah feel each time his fickle people rebelled? “They would make him feel hurt,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">verse 40</a>. Another translation says that they would “give him cause for grief.” One Bible reference work explains: “The meaning here is that the conduct of the Hebrews was such as was fitted to cause pain,​—as the conduct of a disobedient and rebellious child is.” Just as an unruly child can cause his parents much pain of heart, the rebellious Israelites “pained even the Holy One of Israel.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Verse 41</a>.</p>

It was “the grain of heaven” in that its source was heavenly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006523/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 105:40</a>) Since angels, or “powerful ones,” dwell in heaven, the phrase “the very bread of angels” may simply mean that it was provided by God, who dwells in heaven. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006523/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 11:4</a>) Jehovah may also have used angels to provide the manna for the Israelites.</p>

<strong>[<em>bt</em> chap. 14 ¶11-20]</strong> <br/><strong>“We Have Come to a Unanimous Decision”</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> The governing body in Jerusalem had reached a unanimous decision on the issue of circumcision. For the brothers in the congregations to act in unity, however, that decision had to be communicated to them clearly and in a positive, encouraging way. How could this best be done? The account explains: “The apostles and the elders, together with the whole congregation, decided to send chosen men from among them to Antioch, along with Paul and Barnabas; they sent Judas who was called Barsabbas and Silas, who were leading men among the brothers.” In addition, a letter was prepared and sent along with these men so that it could be read in all the congregations in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 15:22-26</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12, 13. What good was accomplished by sending (a) Judas and Silas? (b) a letter from the governing body?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> As “leading men among the brothers,” Judas and Silas were fully qualified to act as representatives of the governing body. The delegation of four men would make it clear that the message they brought was, not simply a reply to the original inquiry, but the express direction of the governing body. The presence of these “chosen men” would forge a close bond between the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem and the Gentile Christians in the field. What a wise and loving arrangement! It no doubt promoted peace and harmony among God’s people.</p>
<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> HOW THE GOVERNING BODY IS ORGANIZED TODAY</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Like the first-century Christians, Jehovah’s Witnesses today are directed by a Governing Body of dedicated, spirit-anointed men. The Governing Body meets weekly as a group. Its members are also organized into the following six committees, each having its own responsibilities.</p><ul><li><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="su">  The <em>Coordinators’ Committee</em> oversees legal matters and the use of the media when necessary to convey an accurate picture of our beliefs. It also responds to disasters, outbreaks of persecution, and other emergencies affecting Jehovah’s Witnesses anywhere in the world.</p></li><li><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="su">  The <em>Personnel Committee</em> oversees arrangements for the spiritual and personal welfare of Bethel family members, who serve in the branch offices of Jehovah’s Witnesses earth wide. In addition, this committee supervises the inviting of additional new members to serve at branch offices.</p></li><li><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="su">  The <em>Publishing Committee</em> supervises the printing, publishing, and shipping of Bible literature. It oversees the printeries and properties owned and operated by the corporations used by Jehovah’s Witnesses and the construction of branch facilities, as well as Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls. This committee also supervises the use of donated funds.</p></li><li><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="su">  The <em>Service Committee</em> oversees the preaching work along with matters affecting congregation elders, circuit overseers, and full-time evangelizers. This committee also invites and assigns students of Gilead School for the purpose of stabilizing and strengthening the worldwide work.</p></li><li><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="su">  The <em>Teaching Committee</em> oversees the instruction provided at assemblies, conventions, and congregation meetings, as well as the development of audio and video programs. It prepares curriculums for Gilead School, the Pioneer Service School, and other schools and arranges spiritual programs for branch office volunteers.</p></li><li><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="su">  The <em>Writing Committee</em> supervises the production of spiritual food for the congregations and for the general public. It also answers Bible questions, oversees translation work worldwide, and approves such material as drama scripts and talk outlines.</p></li></ul><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="se">The Governing Body relies on God’s holy spirit for direction. Its members do not regard themselves as the leaders of Jehovah’s people. Rather, like all anointed Christians on earth, they “keep following the Lamb [Jesus Christ] no matter where he goes.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 14:4</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> The letter provided clear direction for Gentile Christians not only regarding the circumcision issue but also regarding what they must do in order to receive Jehovah’s favor and blessing. The key part of the letter stated: “The holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things: to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">14. How is it possible for Jehovah’s people to work in unity in today’s divisive world?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Today, harmony of belief and unity of action prevail among Jehovah’s Witnesses, who total well over 8,000,000 in more than 100,000 congregations around the earth. How is such unity possible, especially <span id="page114" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="114" data-before-text="114"></span>in view of the turmoil and divisive thinking prevalent in today’s world? Principally, unity results from the clear and decisive direction that Jesus Christ, the Head of the congregation, provides through “the faithful and discreet slave,” that is, the Governing Body. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>) Unity also results from the way the worldwide brotherhood cooperates willingly with the direction of the Governing Body.</p><h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>“They Rejoiced Over the Encouragement” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 15:30-35</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h2><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">15, 16. What was the outcome of the circumcision issue, and what accounted for such a result?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> The account in Acts goes on to tell us that when the delegation of brothers from Jerusalem reached Antioch, “they gathered the whole group together and handed them the letter.” How did the brothers there react to the direction from the governing body? “After reading [the letter], they rejoiced over the encouragement.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 15:30, 31</a>) In addition, Judas and Silas “encouraged the brothers with many talks and strengthened them.” In that sense, the two men were “prophets,” much as Barnabas, Paul, and others were called prophets​—a term referring to those who declared or made known God’s will.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 13:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 15:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Ex. 7:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s blessing was clearly upon the entire arrangement, bringing the issue to a happy resolution. What was the key to the positive outcome? Unquestionably, it was the governing body’s clear and timely direction, based on God’s Word and on the guidance of the holy spirit. Added to that was the loving, personal way in which the decisions were communicated to the congregations.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">17. How was the pattern set for some features of visits by circuit overseers in our day?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Following that pattern, the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses today provides timely direction to the worldwide brotherhood. When decisions are made, they are communicated to the congregations in a clear and direct manner. One way is by visits of circuit overseers. These self-sacrificing brothers travel from one congregation to another, providing clear direction and warm encouragement. Like Paul and Barnabas, they spend much time in the ministry, “teaching and declaring, along with many others, the good news of the word of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 15:35</a>) Like Judas and Silas, they encourage “the brothers with many talks” and strengthen them.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18. How can God’s people be certain to continue to receive Jehovah’s blessing?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> What about the congregations? What will enable the congregations throughout the earth to continue to enjoy peace and harmony in today’s divisive world? Recall that it was the disciple James who later <span id="page115" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>wrote: “The wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey . . . Moreover, the fruit of righteousness is sown in peaceful conditions for those who are making peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jas. 3:17, 18</a>) Whether James had the meeting in Jerusalem in mind or not, we have no way of telling. But from our consideration of the events recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts chapter 15</a>, it is certain that only when there is unity and cooperation can there be Jehovah’s blessing.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19, 20. (a) How was it evident that peace and unity existed in the Antioch congregation? (b) What were Paul and Barnabas now able to do?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> That peace and unity now existed in the Antioch congregation was clearly evident. Rather than contending with the brothers from Jerusalem, the brothers in Antioch treasured the visit of Judas and Silas. The account states: “After they had spent some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them,” that is, back to Jerusalem.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009057/3">d</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 15:33</a>) We can be sure that the brothers in Jerusalem also rejoiced when they heard what the two men had to say about their journey. Thanks to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, their mission was happily accomplished!</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Paul and Barnabas, who remained in Antioch, could now focus their efforts on taking a strong lead in the evangelizing work, much as circuit overseers today do when they visit the congregations under their care. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009057/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 13:2, 3</a>) What a blessing for Jehovah’s people! How, though, did Jehovah further use and bless these two zealous evangelizers? This we shall see in the next chapter.</p>
