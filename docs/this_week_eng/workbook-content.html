<strong>[<em>w01</em> 1/1 11 ¶13]</strong> <br/><strong>Be Built Up by Love</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> From Jesus’ words, it is clear that first and foremost we should love Jehovah. However, we are not born with a fully developed love of Jehovah. That is something we must cultivate. When we first heard about him, we were attracted to him by what we heard. Little by little, we learned how he prepared the earth for mankind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Genesis 2:5-23</a>) We learned how he has dealt with mankind, not casting us off when sin first invaded the human family, but taking steps to redeem us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 15</a>) He dealt kindly with those who were faithful, and eventually he provided his only-begotten Son for the forgiveness of our sins. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">John 3:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 36</a>) This increasing knowledge made our appreciation for Jehovah grow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:1</a>) King David said that he loved Jehovah because of His loving care. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 116:1-9</a>) Today, Jehovah cares for us, guides us, strengthens us, and encourages us. The more we learn about him, the deeper our love becomes.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Psalm 31:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Zephaniah 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001002/38/2" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> Romans 8:28</a>.</p>

<strong>[<em>w09</em> 7/15 29 ¶4-5]</strong> <br/><strong>Accept Gratefully—Give Wholeheartedly</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The psalmist wondered: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12</a>) What benefits had he received? Jehovah had sustained him during a period of “distress and grief.” Moreover, Jehovah had “rescued [his] soul from death.” Now he wanted to “repay” Jehovah somehow. What could the psalmist do? He said: “My vows I shall pay to Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 116:3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 10-14</a>) He resolved to keep all the solemn promises that he had made to Jehovah and to fulfill all his obligations to him.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">You can do the same. How? By following a life course that at all times conforms to God’s laws and principles. Hence, make sure that your worship of Jehovah remains the most important thing in your life and that you let God’s spirit guide you in everything you do.

Still, it does ‘make Jehovah’s heart rejoice’ to see that you are wholeheartedly giving of yourself in his service.

We can be comforted by remembering that Jehovah sees and values not only our actions but also our motives. For example, if you are elderly and can no longer do as much as you would like, be assured that Jehovah sees beyond your limitations. You may feel that you have little to offer, but Jehovah sees the love deep within you that motivates you to do what you <strong><em>can</em></strong> do. He is pleased to accept the best that you can give.</p>

<strong>[<em>w12</em> 5/15 22 ¶1-2]</strong> <br/><strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ An inspired psalmist sang: “Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his loyal ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 116:15</a>) The life of every true worshipper of Jehovah is very valuable to him. However, more than the death of an individual is meant by the words just quoted from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 116</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When delivering a memorial talk for a Christian, it is not fitting to apply <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 116:15</a> to the deceased person, even though he died as a loyal servant of Jehovah. Why? Because the psalmist’s statement has a broader significance. It means that God counts the death of <em>the entire group of his loyal ones</em> too costly for him to let it take place.​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 72:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 116:8</a>.</p>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> CORINTH​—MASTER OF TWO SEAS</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Ancient Corinth lay on an isthmus between the Greek mainland and the southern peninsula, the Peloponnese. The isthmus was less than four miles (6 km) wide at its narrowest point, so Corinth had two ports. On the Gulf of Corinth was Lechaeum, serving sea routes heading westward to Italy, Sicily, and Spain. On the Saronic Gulf, Cenchreae served maritime traffic to and from the Aegean region, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Since the capes at the southern extremity of the Peloponnese were windswept and dangerous for shipping, navigators often preferred to anchor at one of Corinth’s two ports, have their cargo transported overland, and reload it at the other port. Lightweight ships could even be hauled over the isthmus on a platform that ran along a grooved pavement from sea to sea. The city’s position thus allowed it to dominate east-west maritime commerce and also north-south overland trade. Lively commerce brought to Corinth not only wealth but also vices common to many ports.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> In the apostle Paul’s day, Corinth was the capital of the Roman province of Achaia and an important administrative center. The religious diversity of the city is attested to by the presence of a temple for the imperial cult, shrines and temples dedicated to numerous Greek and Egyptian divinities, and a Jewish synagogue.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 18:4</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> The athletic competitions held every two years at nearby Isthmia were second in importance only to the Olympic Games. The apostle Paul would have been in Corinth during the games of 51 C.E. Hence, comments one Bible dictionary, “it can hardly be coincidental that his first use of athletic imagery appears in a letter to Corinth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:24-27</a>.</p><h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>“They Were Tentmakers by Trade” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 18:1-4</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h2><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">4, 5. (a) Where did Paul stay while in Corinth, and what secular work did he do? (b) How may Paul have come to be a tentmaker?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Some time after arriving in Corinth, Paul met a hospitable couple​—a natural Jew named Aquila and his wife, Priscilla, or Prisca. The couple took up residence in Corinth because of a decree by Emperor Claudius ordering “all the Jews to leave Rome.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 18:1, 2</a>) Aquila and Priscilla welcomed Paul not only into their home but also into their business. We read: “Because he [Paul] had the same trade, he <span id="page149" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="149" data-before-text="149"></span>stayed at their home and worked with them, for they were tentmakers by trade.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 18:3</a>) The home of this warmhearted couple remained Paul’s place of dwelling during his ministry in Corinth. While he was staying with Aquila and Priscilla, Paul may have written some of the letters that later became part of the Bible canon.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009063/1">b</a></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> How is it that Paul, a man who had been educated “at the feet of Gamaliel,” was also a tentmaker by trade? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 22:3</a>) The Jews of the first century apparently did not consider it beneath their dignity to teach their children a trade, even though such children may have received additional education as well. Having come from Tarsus in Cilicia, the area famous for a cloth named <em>cilicium</em> from which tents were made, Paul likely learned the trade during his youth. What did tentmaking involve? The trade could involve weaving the tent cloth or cutting and sewing the coarse, stiff material in order to make the tents. Either way, it was hard work.</p>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> CORINTH​—MASTER OF TWO SEAS</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Ancient Corinth lay on an isthmus between the Greek mainland and the southern peninsula, the Peloponnese. The isthmus was less than four miles (6 km) wide at its narrowest point, so Corinth had two ports. On the Gulf of Corinth was Lechaeum, serving sea routes heading westward to Italy, Sicily, and Spain. On the Saronic Gulf, Cenchreae served maritime traffic to and from the Aegean region, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Since the capes at the southern extremity of the Peloponnese were windswept and dangerous for shipping, navigators often preferred to anchor at one of Corinth’s two ports, have their cargo transported overland, and reload it at the other port. Lightweight ships could even be hauled over the isthmus on a platform that ran along a grooved pavement from sea to sea. The city’s position thus allowed it to dominate east-west maritime commerce and also north-south overland trade. Lively commerce brought to Corinth not only wealth but also vices common to many ports.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> In the apostle Paul’s day, Corinth was the capital of the Roman province of Achaia and an important administrative center. The religious diversity of the city is attested to by the presence of a temple for the imperial cult, shrines and temples dedicated to numerous Greek and Egyptian divinities, and a Jewish synagogue.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 18:4</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> The athletic competitions held every two years at nearby Isthmia were second in importance only to the Olympic Games. The apostle Paul would have been in Corinth during the games of 51 C.E. Hence, comments one Bible dictionary, “it can hardly be coincidental that his first use of athletic imagery appears in a letter to Corinth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:24-27</a>.</p>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> INSPIRED LETTERS THAT PROVIDED ENCOURAGEMENT</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> During his 18-month stay in Corinth, about 50-52 C.E., the apostle Paul wrote at least two letters that became part of the Christian Greek Scriptures​—First and Second Thessalonians. He wrote his letter to the Galatians either during the same period or shortly afterward.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> <em>First Thessalonians</em> is the earliest of Paul’s inspired writings. Paul visited Thessalonica in about 50 C.E., during his second preaching tour. The congregation that was formed there soon had to contend with opposition, which forced Paul and Silas to leave the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Acts 17:1-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Concerned about the welfare of the fledgling congregation, Paul twice attempted to return, but “Satan cut across [his] path.” Paul therefore sent Timothy to comfort and strengthen the brothers. Likely late in the year 50 C.E., Timothy rejoined Paul in Corinth and brought a good report about the Thessalonian congregation. Thereafter, Paul penned this letter.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:17–3:7</a>.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> <em>Second Thessalonians</em> was probably written soon after the first letter, perhaps in 51 C.E. In both letters, Timothy and Silvanus (called Silas in Acts) joined Paul in sending greetings, but we have no record of these three being together again after Paul’s stay in Corinth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 18:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 1 Thess. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 2 Thess. 1:1</a>) Why did Paul write this second letter? He had apparently received more news about the congregation, perhaps via the person who had delivered his first letter. This report moved Paul not only to praise the brothers for their love and endurance but also to correct the idea of some in Thessalonica that the Lord’s presence was imminent.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1:3-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Paul’s letter to the <em>Galatians</em> implies that he had visited them at least twice before writing to them. In 47-48 C.E., Paul and Barnabas visited Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe, all of which lay within the Roman province of Galatia. In 49 C.E., Paul returned to the same area with Silas. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Acts 13:1–14:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 16:1-6</a>) Paul penned this letter because Judaizers, who followed quickly on his heels, were teaching that circumcision and observance of the Law of Moses were necessary for Christians. Doubtless Paul wrote to the Galatians as soon as he heard of this false teaching. He may well have written from Corinth, but it is also possible that he wrote either from Ephesus, during a brief stopover on his journey back to Syrian Antioch, or from Antioch itself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009063/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Acts 18:18-23</a>.</p>
