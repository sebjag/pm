<strong>[<em>w07</em> 3/1 22 ¶11]</strong> <br/><strong>Let Us Exalt Jehovah’s Name Together</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> <em>“I will bless Jehovah at all times; constantly his praise will be in my mouth.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 34:1</a>) Living as an outcast, David must have had many material concerns, but as these words show, his daily cares did not overshadow his determination to praise Jehovah. What a fine example for us when we face hardships! Whether we are at school, at work, with fellow Christians, or in the public ministry, our uppermost desire should be to praise Jehovah. Just think of the countless reasons we have to do so! For example, there is no end to what we can discover and enjoy in Jehovah’s marvelous works of creation. And consider what he has accomplished by means of the earthly part of his organization! Although they are imperfect, Jehovah has used faithful humans mightily in modern times. How do God’s works compare with those of men who are idolized by the world? Do you not agree with David, who also wrote: “There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah, neither are there any works like yours”?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 86:8</a>.</p>

For example, he <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>did not brag about the way he deceived the king of Gath. He realized that Jehovah protected him when he was in Gath and that he escaped with Jehovah’s help.

Because of this, meek ones were drawn to Jehovah. Jesus likewise magnified the name of Jehovah, and this drew humble, teachable people to Him. Today, meek ones of all nations are drawn to the international congregation of anointed Christians, of which Jesus is the Head. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Colossians 1:18</a>) The hearts of such meek ones are touched when they hear God’s name glorified by his humble servants and when they hear the Bible’s message, which God’s holy spirit enables them to grasp.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 6:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Acts 16:14</a>.</p>

Hence, he went on to say: <em>“This afflicted one called, and Jehovah himself heard.

This strengthens the faith of our fellow believers, just as David’s expressions strengthened the faith of his supporters. In <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>David’s case, his companions <em>“looked to</em> [<em>Jehovah</em>] <em>and became radiant, and their very faces could not possibly be ashamed.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 34:5</a>) Though on the run from King Saul, they did not feel ashamed. They were confident that God was backing David, and their faces were radiant. In a similar way, newly interested ones as well as those who have been true Christians for a long time look to Jehovah for support. Since they have personally experienced his help, their radiant faces reflect their determination to remain faithful.</p>

Jehovah’s Witnesses enjoy getting together with their friends, and they might choose to drink alcoholic beverages moderately, if at all. They do their best to follow the Bible’s counsel: “Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019300/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="61"></span>Therefore, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not participate in carnivals or similar festivals that promote indecent conduct condemned in the Bible. This includes the Jewish festival of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/502019300/3/0"><em>Purim</em></a><em>.</em> Although Purim has long commemorated the deliverance of the Jews in the fifth century B.C.E., it might now “be loosely but fairly described as the Jewish answer to Mardi Gras or Carnival,” says the book <em>Essential Judaism.</em> For many revelers, “it involves dressing in costume (often in drag), riotous behavior, excessive drinking, and making lots of noise.”</p></li></ul><h2 id="p67" data-pid="67"><strong>Do Jehovah’s Witnesses, who do not celebrate certain holidays, still love their families?</strong></h2><p id="p68" data-pid="68"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="62"></span>Yes. The Bible teaches people to love and respect all family members, regardless of their faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019300/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:​1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019300/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Of course, when one of Jehovah’s Witnesses stops sharing in certain celebrations, some of his or her relatives may feel upset, hurt, or even betrayed. Therefore, many of Jehovah’s Witnesses take the initiative to reassure their relatives of their love, to explain tactfully the reasons for their decisions, and to visit their relatives on other occasions.</p><h2 id="p69" data-pid="69"><strong>Do Jehovah’s Witnesses tell others not to celebrate certain holidays?</strong></h2><p id="p70" data-pid="70"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="63"></span>No. They believe that each person must make his own decision. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019300/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Joshua 24:15</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses “honor men of all sorts,” <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/502019300/5">regardless of their religious beliefs</a>.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019300/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:​17</a>.</p>	<!-- Root element of lightbox -->

The autumn sun warms Peter as he prays on the flat rooftop of a house near the sea in the harbor city of Joppa. He has been a guest in this home for some days now. His willingness to stay here reveals, to an extent, an unprejudiced attitude. The owner, a certain Simon, is a tanner by trade, and not every Jew would lodge with such a man.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009052/0">a</a> Still, Peter is about to learn a vital lesson regarding Jehovah’s impartiality.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> While Peter is praying, he falls into a trance. What he sees in a vision would disturb any Jew. Descending from heaven is a sheetlike vessel containing animals unclean according to the Law. Told to slaughter and eat, Peter replies: “I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.” Not once but three times he is told: “Stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009052/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 10:14-16</a>) The vision leaves Peter confused but not for long.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> What did Peter’s vision mean? It is important that we grasp its significance, for at the heart of this vision is a profound truth about the way Jehovah views people. As true Christians, we cannot bear thorough witness about God’s Kingdom unless we learn to share God’s view of people. To unlock the meaning of Peter’s vision, let us examine the dramatic events that surrounded it.</p><h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Making “Supplication to God Continually” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009052/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 10:1-8</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h2><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">4, 5.

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> CORNELIUS AND THE ROMAN ARMY</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Administrative and military headquarters for the Roman province of Judea were located in Caesarea. The troops under the governor’s command consisted of 500 to 1,000 cavalry and five cohorts, or groups, of infantry. A cohort in full strength consisted of about 600 soldiers. These troops were usually recruited from among Roman subjects rather than citizens. Most served in Caesarea, but small garrisons were scattered throughout Judea. One cohort was permanently based in the Tower of Antonia in Jerusalem in order to police the Temple Mount and the city. The Roman presence in that city would be reinforced during Jewish festivals to deal with possible disturbances.</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> A centurion was in command of about 100 soldiers. The Greek text of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009052/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Acts 10:1</a> says that Cornelius was a centurion of the so-called Italian unit, probably based in Caesarea. This unit may have been the Second Italian Cohort of Roman Citizen Volunteers.<a id="footnotesource6" data-fnid="6" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009052/5">f</a> Centurions had considerable social and military status, as well as wealth. Their pay was perhaps 16 times that of regular soldiers.</p>
