<div class="padding"><strong>[<em>it</em>-1 1210 ¶4]</strong> <br/><strong>Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Job.</em></strong> Job, who evidently lived in the period between the death of Joseph and the time of Moses, is described as a man who had “proved to be blameless [Heb., <em>tam</em>] and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:1</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/3">JOB</a>.) That human integrity forms part of the issue between Jehovah God and Satan is clear from God’s questioning his Adversary about Job when Satan appeared during an angelic assembly in the courts of heaven. Satan imputed false motive to Job’s worship of God, alleging that Job served not out of pure devotion but for selfish benefits. He thereby placed in question Job’s integrity to God. Permitted to divest Job of his vast possessions and even of his children, Satan failed to crack Job’s integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 1:6–2:3</a>) He then claimed that Job was selfishly willing to endure the loss of possessions and children as long as he could save his own skin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) Thereafter stricken with a painful, consuming disease and subjected to dissuasion from his own wife as well as to disparaging criticism and slurs from companions who misrepresented God’s standards and purposes (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 2:6-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 22:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 5-11</a>), Job’s response was that he would not deny having been a man of integrity. “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself! On my justness I have laid hold, and I shall not let it go; my heart will not taunt me for any of my days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 27:5, 6</a>) His maintaining integrity demonstrated that God’s Adversary was a liar.</p>

(b) What examples show that completeness, soundness, or wholeness matter to us?</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> When applied to us as servants of God, integrity means wholehearted love for and unbreakable devotion to Jehovah as a Person, so that his will comes first in all our decisions. Consider some background. One basic meaning of the Bible word for “integrity” is this: complete, sound, or whole. For example, the Israelites offered up animals in sacrifice to Jehovah, and the Law said that the animals had to be sound.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2019281/1">b</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 22:21, 22</a>) God’s people were not allowed to offer up an animal that was missing a leg, an ear, or an eye; nor could they offer one full of disease. It was important to Jehovah that the animal be complete, sound, or whole. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mal. 1:6-9</a>) We can understand why Jehovah cares about soundness or completeness. When we purchase something, whether a piece of fruit, a book, or a tool, we do not want one that has gaping holes or parts missing. We want one that is complete, sound, or whole. Jehovah feels similarly when it comes to our love for him, our loyalty. It must be complete, sound, or whole.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong><strong> (a) Why can an imperfect person have integrity? (b) According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 103:12-14</a>, what does Jehovah expect of us?</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Should we conclude that we must be perfect in order to have integrity? After all, we may feel that we are less than sound, or even very flawed. Consider two reasons why we need not fear. First, Jehovah does not focus on our flaws. His Word tells us: “If errors were what you watch, O Jah, then who, O Jehovah, could stand?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 130:3</a>) He knows that we are imperfect, sinful humans, and he forgives us generously. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5</a>) Second, Jehovah knows our limitations, and he does not expect more of us than we can do. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 103:12-14</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> In what sense, then, can we be complete, sound, or whole in his eyes?</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong><strong> For servants of Jehovah, how is love the key to integrity?</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> For servants of Jehovah, the key to integrity is love. Our love for God, our loyal devotion to him as our heavenly Father, must remain complete, sound, or whole. If our love remains like that even when we are tested, then we have integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matt. 22:37</a>) Consider again the three Witnesses we described at the outset. Why do they act as they do? Does the young girl hate having fun at school, or does the young man hope to be embarrassed at a door, or does the family man want to lose his job? Of course not. Rather, they know that Jehovah has righteous standards, and their minds are focused on what pleases their heavenly Father. Their love for him moves them to put him first in the decisions they make. They thus put their integrity into action.</p>

Why, planets in our solar system travel in orbits around the sun as though they were humbly obeying traffic laws! Surely the mind-boggling order evident in the universe helps us to see that Jehovah, who “skillfully made the heavens” and the earth, deserves our praise, loyalty, and worship.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016848/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 136:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016848/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5-9</a>.</p>

<strong>[<em>lff</em> lesson 13 intro and points 1-3]</strong> <br/><strong>How False Religion Misrepresents God</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3">If God is love, why have so many evil acts been committed by religions that claim to represent him? Put simply, these religions are false; they misrepresent God. How have they misrepresented him? How does he feel about that? And what will he do about it?</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>How does false religion misrepresent God by its <em>teachings?</em></strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">False religion has <strong>“exchanged the truth of God for the lie.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021213/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 1:25</a>) For example, most religions have not taught their followers God’s name. However, the Bible says that God’s name must be used. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021213/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 10:13, 14</a>) Some religious leaders say that when something terrible happens, it is God’s will. But that is a lie. God is never the source of evil. (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021213/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 1:13</a>.) Sadly, religious lies have pushed people away from God.</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>How does false religion misrepresent God by its <em>actions?</em></strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">False religion does not treat people as Jehovah does. The Bible says that false religion’s <strong>“sins have massed together clear up to heaven.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021213/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 18:5</a>) For centuries, religions have meddled in politics, supported wars, and caused or approved the death of countless numbers of people. Some religious leaders enjoy a lavish lifestyle and demand money from their followers to pay for it. These actions prove that they do not even know God, let alone have the right to represent him.​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021213/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>How does God feel about false religion?</strong></h3><p id="p9" data-pid="9">If the things done by false religion make you angry, how do you think Jehovah feels? He loves people, but he is angry with religious leaders who misrepresent him and mistreat their followers. He promises that false religion will be destroyed and <strong>“will never be found again.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021213/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 18:21</a>) Soon, God will put an end to all false religion.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021213/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 18:8</a>.</p>

<strong>[<em>bt</em> chap. 3 ¶4-11]</strong> <br/><strong>“Filled With Holy Spirit”</strong><br/><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The Christian congregation began with about 120 disciples who were “all together at the same place”​—an upper room—​and who were anointed with holy spirit. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:1</a>) By the end of that day, baptized members of that congregation numbered into the thousands. And that was just the beginning of the growth of an organization that continues to expand today! Yes, a community of God-fearing men and women​—the modern-day Christian congregation—​is the means by which the “good news of the Kingdom” is being “preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations” before the end of this system of things.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5.

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> ROME​—CAPITAL OF AN EMPIRE</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> During the period of time covered by the book of Acts, Rome was the largest and politically the most important city in the then-known world. It was the capital of an empire that at its peak dominated lands stretching from Britain to North Africa and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Rome was a melting pot of cultures, races, languages, and superstitions. A network of well-maintained roads brought travelers and merchandise from every corner of the empire. At the nearby port of Ostia, ships that plied busy trade routes unloaded foodstuffs and luxury goods destined for the city.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> By the first century C.E., well over a million people lived in Rome. Perhaps half of the population were slaves​—condemned criminals, children sold or abandoned by their parents, and prisoners captured during campaigns by the Roman legions. Among those brought to Rome as slaves were Jews from Jerusalem, following the conquest of that city by Roman General Pompey in 63 B.C.E.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Most of the free population were paupers, who lived in crowded multistory housing and depended on government subsidies. The emperors, however, adorned their capital with some of the most magnificent public buildings ever seen. Among them were theaters and great stadiums that offered such spectacles as stage performances, gladiatorial contests, and chariot racing​—all free for the entertainment of the masses.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">6, 7. How is the Christian congregation today fulfilling Jesus’ commission to preach to all nations?</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Today, the Christian congregation has the same objectives that it had in the first century. Jesus gave his disciples a challenging yet thrilling work to perform. He told them: “Make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The Christian congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses is the agency through which that work is accomplished today. Of course, it is a challenge to reach people of different languages. Yet, Jehovah’s Witnesses have produced Bible-based material in more than 1,000 languages. If you are actively associated with the Christian congregation and are sharing in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work, you have reason to rejoice. You are counted among the comparatively few on earth today who have the privilege of bearing thorough witness to Jehovah’s name!</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8. What help do we get through the Christian congregation?</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> To help you endure with joy during these critical times, Jehovah God has provided a worldwide association of brothers. Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians: “Let us consider one another so <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>as to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) The Christian congregation is a provision from Jehovah so that you can encourage others and also be encouraged yourself. Stay close to your spiritual brothers and sisters. Never forsake gathering together at Christian meetings!</p><br/>&nbsp;<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>“Each One Heard . . . in His Own Language” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 2:5-13</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h2><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/bt/2022/38" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/bt/2022/39" alt="Jesus’ disciples preaching to Jews and proselytes on a busy street." width="450" height="528" class="east_right half" />

Most of those present likely spoke a common language, perhaps Greek or Hebrew. But now “each one heard [the disciples] speaking in his own language.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 2:6</a>) Surely those listeners must have been touched to hear the good news in their mother tongue. Of course, Christians today are not gifted with a miraculous ability to speak foreign tongues. Many, however, have made themselves available to spread the Kingdom message to people of all national groups. How? Some have learned a new language so that they can serve with a nearby foreign-language congregation or even move to a foreign land. Often, they have found that their listeners are quite impressed by their efforts.</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Consider Christine, who took a Gujarati course along with seven other Witnesses. When she encountered a Gujarati-speaking workmate, she greeted the young woman in her native tongue. The woman was impressed and wanted to know why Christine was making the effort to learn such a difficult language as Gujarati. Christine was able to give a fine witness. The young woman <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>remarked to Christine: “You must really have something important to say.”</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11.

Nevertheless, we can be prepared to preach the Kingdom message to people of other language groups. How? One way is by using the <em>JW Language</em><sup>®</sup> app to learn a simple greeting in a language commonly spoken in your area. You can also learn a few phrases in that language that may arouse the interest of those who speak it. Direct them to jw.org, and perhaps show them the variety of videos and publications available in their language. By using such tools in our ministry, we may have the same joy that our first-century brothers had when people from foreign lands were amazed to hear the good news “each one . . . in his own language.”</p>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> JEWS IN MESOPOTAMIA AND EGYPT</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> <em>The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ</em> (175 B.C.–A.D. 135) states: “In <em>Mesopotamia, Media</em> and <em>Babylonia</em> lived the descendants of members of the kingdom of the ten tribes [of Israel], and of the kingdom of Judah, once deported there by the Assyrians and the Babylonians.” According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezra 2:64</a>, only 42,360 Israelites returned to Jerusalem from their Babylonian exile. This took place in 537 B.C.E. Flavius Josephus remarks that in the first century C.E., the Jews who “dwelt about Babylonia” numbered into the tens of thousands. In the third to the fifth centuries C.E., these communities produced the work known as the Babylonian Talmud.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Documentary evidence exists of a Jewish presence in Egypt at least as early as the sixth century B.C.E. During that period, Jeremiah directed a message to Jews living in various localities of Egypt, including Memphis. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009044/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jer. 44:1</a>, ftn.) It is likely that large numbers immigrated to Egypt during the Hellenistic period. Josephus says that Jews were among the first settlers of Alexandria. In time, an entire section of this city was allotted to them. In the first century C.E., Jewish writer Philo asserted that a million of his fellow countrymen lived throughout Egypt, from “the side of Libya to the boundaries of Ethiopia.”</p>
