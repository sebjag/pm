She was in daily association with many young women from all over the Persian Empire who were competing for the attention of the king. Yet, she remained respectful and composed.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102013261/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 2:15</a>) She probably realized that beauty alone would not win the king’s heart; a modest and humble spirit would prove a far rarer commodity in that court.

<br/>&nbsp;<strong>ASK YOURSELF,</strong> ‘What do my words and actions reveal about the way I view myself?’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/202023322/3/0"><em>w17.01</em> 25 ¶12</a>.

We realize that we win people’s hearts, not by boasting or drawing undue attention to ourselves, but by displaying a “quiet and mild spirit.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017247/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 3:3, 4;</strong></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017247/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jer. 9:23, 24</a>) Vain sentiments in our hearts will eventually show up in our actions. We might drop hints, for example, implying that we enjoy special privileges, possess inside information, or have special relationships with responsible brothers. Or we might explain things in such a way that only we get the credit for ideas or accomplishments that others also contributed to. Again, Jesus set a wonderful example. A good portion of what he said was either a quotation from or an allusion to the Hebrew Scriptures. He modestly spoke that way so that his hearers would know that what he said was coming from Jehovah and was not the product of his own intellect or wisdom.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017247/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 8:28</a>.</p>

<strong>[<em>w22.11</em> 31 ¶3-6]</strong> <br/><strong>Did You Know?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Researchers discovered a Persian cuneiform text that mentions a man named <em>Marduka</em> (English Mordecai). He worked as an administrator, possibly an accountant, in Shushan. Arthur Ungnad, an expert in Oriental history, reported that this cuneiform was “the only extra-Biblical reference to Mordecai” at the time.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Since Ungnad’s report, scholars have translated thousands of other Persian cuneiforms. Among these are the Persepolis tablets, which were found in the ruins of the Treasury, near the city walls. These tablets date back to the reign of Xerxes I. They are in the Elamite language and contain several names found in the book of Esther.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2022647/0">a</a></p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w22/2022/804" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w22/2022/805" alt="" width="300" height="392" class="east_right half" /><figcaption class="figcaption"><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> The name Mordecai (Marduka) as it appears in Persian cuneiform writing</p></figcaption><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Several Persepolis tablets mention the name <em>Marduka,</em> who served as a royal scribe at the palace in Shushan during the reign of Xerxes I. One tablet describes <em>Marduka</em> as a translator. That detail fits the Bible’s description of Mordecai. He was an official who served in the court of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) and who spoke at least two languages. Mordecai regularly sat in the king’s gate of the palace in Shushan. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022647/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 2:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022647/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022647/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 3:3</a>) This royal gate stood as an imposing building and was the workplace of palace officials.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">There are remarkable similarities between <em>Marduka</em> mentioned in the tablets and Mordecai mentioned in the Bible. They lived at the same time and in the same place and served in official positions at the same place of work. All these similarities together suggest that the archaeological discoveries may relate to the Mordecai described in the book of Esther.</p>

About two years after those events in Jerusalem, Paul was on a ship heading for Italy when the vessel encountered such a heavy storm that the crew and passengers thought they would die. Yet, Paul was not afraid. Why? He told those aboard: “This night an angel of the God to whom I belong and to whom I render sacred service stood by me and said: ‘Have no fear, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and look! God has granted to you all those sailing with you.’” Jehovah had used an angel to repeat the assurance that He had given Paul earlier by means of Jesus.

Why? Because some days are difficult for us to endure. For instance, when a loved one dies, we must deal with that pain not just for a few days but likely for many years. Others must deal with the difficult days that come with old age. Still others face days on which they are overwhelmed by feelings of depression.

Each of us plays a role in maintaining it.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. What is remarkable among God’s people?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">If you attend a congregation meeting in another land, you may find that you cannot understand the language, but in many ways you will feel at home. Why? Because we study the Bible using the same publications everywhere. And we strive to show love for one another. No matter where we live, we all <strong>“call on the name of Jehovah, to worship him in unity.”</strong>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021256/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:9</a>, footnote.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2. What can you do to promote unity?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>“Love one another intensely from the heart.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021256/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:22</a>) How can you apply this counsel? Rather than focusing on the imperfections of others, look for their good qualities. Instead of associating with only those who share your interests, try to get to know brothers and sisters who come from different backgrounds. We can also work hard to root out any feelings of prejudice we may have.​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021256/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:17</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102021256/0">a</a></p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>What will you do when you have a disagreement with a fellow Christian?</strong></h3><p id="p9" data-pid="9">We are united, but we are also imperfect. Sometimes we disappoint or even hurt one another. So God’s Word tells us to <strong>“continue . . . forgiving one another,”</strong> adding: <strong>“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.”</strong> (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021256/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 3:13</a>.)

Infectious Diseases</strong></h2><p id="p41" data-pid="41">Because we love people, we are very careful not to transmit infectious diseases to others. This is true whether we are suffering from an infectious disease or have reason to believe that we might be a carrier of one. We act this way because the Bible commands: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 13:8-10</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42">What does obeying this command mean in practical terms? An infected person should not initiate displays of affection, such as hugging or kissing. He should not react negatively if some feel that, for the protection of their family, they cannot invite him into their home. And before getting baptized, he should inform the coordinator of the body of elders of his condition so that arrangements can be made to protect others who are also getting baptized. Before beginning a courtship, someone who may have been exposed to an infectious disease should voluntarily have a blood test. By doing this, you show that you care about others “as you look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Philippians 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43"><a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/5">Return to lesson 56 point 2</a></p><br/>&nbsp;<h2 class="du-borderStyle-top--solid du-borderColor--gray-100 du-borderWidth--1 du-margin-top--12 du-padding-top--8" id="p44" data-pid="44"><strong>7. Business and Legal Matters</strong></h2><p id="p45" data-pid="45">We can prevent many problems by putting all financial agreements in writing​—even if the agreement is with another Christian. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jeremiah 32:9-12</a>) Still, Christians may sometimes have minor differences with each other about money or other matters. They should be able to settle such differences quickly and peaceably, and in private.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46">How, though, should we settle serious matters such as fraud or slander? (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 18:15-17</a>.) Jesus gave us three steps to follow:</p><ol><li><p id="p47" data-pid="47">             Try to settle the matter between yourselves.​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">verse 15</a>.</p></li><li><p id="p48" data-pid="48">             If that does not work, ask one or two mature ones in the congregation to go with you.​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">verse 16</a>.</p></li><li><p id="p49" data-pid="49">             If the matter is still unresolved, only then should you approach the elders.​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">verse 17</a>.</p></li></ol><p id="p50" data-pid="50">In most cases, we should not take our brothers to court because that could reflect badly on Jehovah and on the congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:1-8</a>) However, there are some situations that may need to be settled legally: divorce proceedings, child custody, alimony payments, insurance claims, bankruptcy cases, or probating wills. A Christian who uses the court to settle such matters as peaceably as he can is not violating the Bible’s counsel.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51">If a serious crime is involved​—such as rape, child abuse, assault, major theft, or murder—​then a Christian who reports it to the secular authorities does not violate the Bible’s counsel.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52"><a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1102021350/6">Return to lesson 56 point 3</a></p>
