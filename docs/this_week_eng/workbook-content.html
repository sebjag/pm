<strong>[<em>w10</em> 10/15 3-4 ¶4-6]</strong> <br/><strong>“Who Has Come to Know the Mind of Jehovah?”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> As we meditate on Jehovah’s activities, we need to avoid the tendency to judge God by human standards. This tendency is alluded to in Jehovah’s words as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010761/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 50:21</a>: “You imagined that I would positively become like you.” It is as one Bible scholar stated over 175 years ago: “Men are apt to judge of God by themselves, and to suppose him restricted by such laws as they deem proper for their own observance.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> We need to be careful not to shape our concept of Jehovah so as to conform it to our own standards and desires. Why is this important? Well, as we study the Scriptures, some of Jehovah’s actions may seem to be not quite right from our limited, imperfect viewpoint. The ancient Israelites fell into <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>that way of thinking and drew a wrong conclusion concerning Jehovah’s dealings with them. Notice what Jehovah said to them: “You people will certainly say: ‘The way of Jehovah is not adjusted right.’ Hear, please, O house of Israel. Is not my own way adjusted right? Are not the ways of you people not adjusted right?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010761/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:25</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6. What lesson did Job learn, and how can we benefit from his experience?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> A key to avoiding the trap of judging Jehovah by our own standards is to recognize that our viewpoint is limited and at times seriously flawed. Job needed to learn this lesson. During his time of suffering, Job struggled with despair and became somewhat self-centered. He lost sight of the bigger issues. But Jehovah lovingly helped him to broaden his viewpoint. By asking Job over 70 different questions, none of which Job could answer, Jehovah emphasized the limitations of Job’s understanding. Job reacted in a humble way, adjusting his viewpoint.​—<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010761/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Job 42:1-6</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<strong>[<em>it</em>-2 808]</strong> <br/><strong>Ridicule</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Job was a man righteously maintaining his integrity through great ridicule. But he developed the wrong viewpoint and made a mistake, for which he was corrected. Elihu said of him: “What able-bodied man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Job 34:7</a>) Job became too concerned with his own justification rather than God’s, and he tended to magnify his own righteousness more than God’s. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 35:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 36:24</a>) In receiving the severe ridicule of his three “companions,” Job tended to count it directed toward himself rather than toward God. In this he was like a person who gives himself up to derision and ridicule and delights in it, taking it in as though he were drinking water with enjoyment. God later explained to Job that these ridiculers were actually (in the final analysis) speaking untruth against <em>God.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) Similarly, Jehovah told the prophet Samuel when Israel demanded a king: “It is not you whom they have rejected, but it is I whom they have rejected from being king over them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1Sa 8:7</a>) And Jesus said to his disciples: “You will be objects of hatred by all the nations [not on your own account, but] on account of <em>my name.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mt 24:9</a>) Keeping these things in mind will enable the Christian to endure ridicule in the right spirit and will qualify him to receive a reward for his endurance.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Lu 6:22, 23</a>.</p>

(b) Why are we keenly interested in the apostles’ stand?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE judges of the Sanhedrin are simmering with rage! The apostles of Jesus are standing trial before this high court. The reason? Joseph Caiaphas, the high priest and president of the Sanhedrin, sternly addresses them: “We strictly ordered you not to keep teaching on the basis of this name.” The angry president cannot bring himself even to utter the name of Jesus. Yet, Caiaphas continues, “you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you are determined to bring the blood of this man upon us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:28</a>) The message is clear: Stop preaching​—or else!</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> How will the apostles respond? Their commission to preach came from Jesus, whose authority was divinely bestowed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>) Will the apostles cave in to fear of man and be silenced? Or will they have the courage to stand firm and continue preaching? The issue really boils down to this: Will they obey God or man? Without hesitation, the apostle Peter speaks for all the apostles. His words are unequivocal and bold.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> As true Christians, we are keenly interested in how the apostles responded to the threats of the Sanhedrin. The commission to preach applies to us as well. In carrying out this God-given assignment, we too may face opposition. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 10:22</a>) Opposers may try to restrict or ban our work. What will we do? We can benefit by considering the stand taken by the apostles and the circumstances that led up to their trial before the Sanhedrin.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102009046/0">a</a></p>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> THE SANHEDRIN​—HIGH COURT OF THE JEWS</h2>
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Although Judea was a province of the Roman Empire, Rome permitted the Jews to observe their own traditions and for the most part to govern themselves. Minor crimes and civil cases were handled by local courts, but questions that those courts could not decide were referred to the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. This body functioned as the supreme court of the Jewish people and as a national administrative council. It also had the final word on the interpretation of Jewish law, and its authority was respected by Jews everywhere.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> The Sanhedrin met in its decision chamber, which appears to have been located either in the temple precincts or in its immediate vicinity. The council was made up of 71 members​—the high priest, who was the president; other priestly nobles, including Sadducees; lay aristocrats; and learned scribes. The decisions of the court were final.</p><h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>“Jehovah’s Angel Opened the Doors” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 5:12-21a</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h2><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">4, 5.

The apostles performed great signs, such as healing the sick and expelling demons. They did so “in Solomon’s Colonnade,” a covered portico on the east side of the temple, where many Jews would gather. Why, even Peter’s shadow apparently effected cures! Many who were healed physically responded to words of spiritual healing. As a result, “believers in the Lord kept on being added, great numbers both of men and of women.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 5:12-15</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Caiaphas and the Sadducees, the religious sect to which he belonged, became “filled with jealousy” and had the apostles thrown in jail. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 5:17, 18</a>) Why were the Sadducees outraged? The apostles were teaching that Jesus had been resurrected, yet the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection. The apostles were saying that only by putting faith in Jesus can one be saved, but the Sadducees feared reprisal from Rome if the people looked to Jesus as their Leader. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 11:48</a>) No wonder the Sadducees were determined to silence the apostles!</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 6.

Such ones often try to use their influence with governmental authorities and the media to silence our preaching. Should we be surprised? No. Our message lays bare false religion. By accepting Bible truths, honesthearted people are set free from unscriptural beliefs and practices. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>) Is it any wonder, then, that our message often causes religious leaders to become filled with jealous hatred?</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">7, 8.

The angel’s words may also have strengthened them to remain firm no matter what happened. With strong faith and courage, the apostles “entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 5:21</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Each of us does well to ask, ‘Would I have the faith and courage needed to continue preaching under similar circumstances?’ We may draw strength from knowing that the vital work of “bearing thorough <span id="page39" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="39" data-before-text="39"></span>witness concerning the Kingdom of God” has angelic backing and direction.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 28:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009046/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Rev. 14:6, 7</a>.</p>
