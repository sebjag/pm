Jesus emphasized that the mind must be kept clean of immoral thoughts when he said: “Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010283/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 5:28</a>.</p>

AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, abortions, ruined relationships, and guilty consciences litter the path of those who have chosen to ignore such signposts. The end of the road for those practicing immorality is clearly stated by the apostle Paul. They “will not inherit God’s kingdom.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008640/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>.</p>

<strong>[<em>w05</em> 11/15 11 ¶3]</strong> <br/><strong>The Art of Listening With Love</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Companions of the man Job heard no fewer than ten of his discourses. Still, Job exclaimed: “O that I had someone listening to me!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005844/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 31:35</a>) Why? Because their listening provided no comfort. They neither cared about Job nor wanted to understand his feelings. They surely did not have fellow feeling as sympathetic listeners. But the apostle Peter counsels: “All of you be like-minded, showing fellow feeling, having brotherly affection, tenderly compassionate, humble in mind.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005844/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:8</a>) How can we show fellow feeling? One way is by showing concern for the other person’s feelings and trying to understand them. Making such sympathetic comments as “that must have been upsetting” or “you must have felt misunderstood” is one way to show that we are concerned. Another way is to put what the person is saying in our own words, thus showing that we understood what he said. Listening with love means paying attention not only to the words but also to the emotions subtly expressed.</p>

<strong>[<em>g16.4</em> 8-9]</strong> <br/><strong>What Does the Bible Say About Homosexuality?</strong><br/><h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span><strong>What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?</strong></h2><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the Bible’s moral code is the best standard for living, and they choose to abide by that code. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>)<a id="endnotesource2" data-enid="2" class="en" href=" /en/wol/en/r1/lp-e/102016128/1"><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></a> This means that Jehovah’s Witnesses reject all sexual misconduct, including homosexuality. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>)<a id="endnotesource3" data-enid="3" class="en" href=" /en/wol/en/r1/lp-e/102016128/2"><strong><sup>[3]</sup></strong></a> That is the Witnesses’ lifestyle choice, and they have a right to it.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">At the same time, Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to “pursue peace with all people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:14</a>) While they reject homosexual acts, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not force their view on others, nor do they participate in homophobic hate crimes or rejoice when they hear of them. Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to follow the Golden Rule by treating others the way they themselves would like to be treated.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>.</p><h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>Does the Bible Promote Prejudice?</strong></h2><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Still, some people would say that the Bible promotes prejudice against homosexuals and that those who adhere to its moral code are intolerant. ‘The Bible was written at a time when people were narrow-minded,’ they claim. ‘Today we accept people of all races, nationalities, and sexual preferences.’ To them, rejecting homosexuality is the same as rejecting people of a different skin color. Is that comparison valid? No. Why not?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Because there is a difference between rejecting homosexual <em>conduct</em> and rejecting homosexual <em>people.</em> The Bible tells Christians to be respectful of all kinds of people. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:17</a>)<a id="endnotesource4" data-enid="4" class="en" href=" /en/wol/en/r1/lp-e/102016128/3"><strong><sup>[4]</sup></strong></a> But that does not mean that Christians must accept all kinds of <em>conduct.</em></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Consider a comparison: Suppose you view smoking as harmful and even repugnant. What if you have a workmate who is a smoker? Would you be considered narrow-minded just because your view of smoking differs from his? Would the fact that he smokes and you do not smoke automatically mean that you are prejudiced against him? If your workmate were to demand that you change your view of smoking, would that not make <em>him</em> narrow-minded and intolerant?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses choose to live by the moral code set forth in the Bible. They do not approve of the <em>actions</em> that the Bible prohibits. But they neither mock nor mistreat <em>people</em> whose practices differ from their own.</p><h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>Is the Bible’s View Cruel?</strong></h2><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">What about people who have homosexual inclinations? Were they born that way? If so, would it not be cruel to say that it is wrong for them to act on their desires?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The Bible does not comment on the biology of homosexuality, although it acknowledges that some human traits are deeply ingrained. Still, the Bible says that certain conduct​—including homosexual acts—​must be shunned if we are to please God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 10:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Some would say that the Bible’s position is cruel. But their claim is based on the premise that we <em>must</em> act on our impulses or that sexual impulses in particular are so important that they should not​—even <em>cannot</em>—​be controlled. However, the Bible dignifies humans by stating that they <em>can</em> resist their urges. Unlike animals, they can choose not to act on their impulses.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>.<a id="endnotesource5" data-enid="5" class="en" href=" /en/wol/en/r1/lp-e/102016128/4"><strong><sup>[5]</sup></strong></a></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Consider a comparison: Some experts say that certain behavioral traits, such as aggression, may have a biological cause. The Bible does not specifically comment on the biology of aggression, but it does <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>acknowledge that some people are <em>“prone</em> to anger” and <em>“disposed</em> to rage.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 29:22</a>) Yet, the Bible also says: “Let go of anger and abandon rage.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 37:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:31</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Few people would disagree with that advice or say that it is cruel to those who have aggressive tendencies. In fact, even those experts who believe that anger is rooted in a person’s genetic makeup work hard to help people control such tendencies.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses take a similar position toward <em>any</em> conduct that conflicts with Bible standards, including sexual acts between two people of the opposite sex who are not married to each other. In all such cases, the Bible counsel applies: “Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not with greedy, uncontrolled sexual passion.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:4, 5</a>.</p><h2 id="p29" data-pid="29"><strong>“That Is What Some of You Were”</strong></h2><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Those who wanted to become Christians in the first century came from various backgrounds and lifestyles, and some of them made significant lifestyle changes. For example, the Bible speaks of “those who are sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts,” and then it adds: <em>“That is what some of you were.”</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">In saying “that is what some of you were,” does the Bible mean that those who stopped engaging in homosexual acts never again experienced any homosexual <em>desires?</em> That could hardly be the case, because the Bible also exhorts: “Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Galatians 5:16</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Note that the Bible does not say that a Christian will never experience an improper desire. Rather, it says that he or she will choose not to <em>carry out</em> that desire. Christians learn to bring such desires under control, not dwelling on them to the point of acting on them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">James 1:14, 15</a>.<a id="endnotesource6" data-enid="6" class="en" href=" /en/wol/en/r1/lp-e/102016128/5"><strong><sup>[6]</sup></strong></a></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">The Bible thus makes a distinction between <em>inclinations</em> and <em>practices.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 7:16-25</a>) A person who has homosexual leanings can control what he allows his mind to dwell on, just as he would control any other wrong desire, including leanings toward anger, adultery, and greed.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">While Jehovah’s Witnesses uphold the moral code set forth in the Bible, they do not force their views on others. Nor do they try to reverse laws that protect the human rights of those whose lifestyle differs from theirs. The message that Jehovah’s Witnesses bear is a positive one, and they eagerly share it with all who will listen.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016128/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 20:20</a>.</p>

Above the clamor of conversation and the sound of shuffling feet, a middle-aged beggar, crippled from birth, calls for alms.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 3:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4:22</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> As Peter and John draw close, the beggar recites his well-worn plea for money.

In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk!” Picture the astonishment of the crowd as Peter takes the crippled man by the hand and​—for the first time in his life—​the man stands upright!

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 15:8-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Acts 3:13-15</a>) Think of the courage Peter displayed as he boldly declared that the crippled man was healed in Jesus’ name. Peter did not water down the truth. He forthrightly condemned the crowd’s complicity in the death of Christ. But Peter harbored no animosity toward these people, for they had “acted in ignorance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 3:17</a>) He appealed to them as his brothers and focused on the positive aspects of the Kingdom message. If they repented and put faith in Christ, “seasons of refreshing” would come to them from Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) We likewise need to be bold and forthright when declaring God’s coming judgment. At the same time, we should never be brash, harsh, or judgmental. Instead, we view those to whom we preach as our potential brothers, and like Peter, we focus especially on the positive aspects of the Kingdom message.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6. How did Peter and John display humility and modesty?</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> The apostles were modest men. They did not take credit for the miraculous deed they had performed. Peter said to the crowd: “Why are you staring at us as though by personal power or godly devotion we have made him walk?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 3:12</a>) Peter and the other apostles knew that any good they accomplished in their ministry was due to God’s power, not their own. As a result, they modestly directed all praise for their achievements to Jehovah and Jesus.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">7, 8. (a) What gift can we offer to people? (b) How is the promise of a “restoration of all things” being fulfilled today?</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We need to show similar modesty as we engage in the Kingdom-preaching work. Granted, God’s spirit does not empower modern-day Christians to perform miraculous healings. Even so, we can help people to develop faith in God and Christ and to receive the same gift Peter offered​—the opportunity to have their sins forgiven and to be refreshed <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>by Jehovah. Each year, hundreds of thousands accept this offer and become baptized disciples of Christ.</p><br/>&nbsp;<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Indeed, we are living at the time of the “restoration of all things” referred to by Peter. In fulfillment of the word “God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old,” the Kingdom was established in heaven in the year 1914. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 3:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Ps. 110:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Dan. 4:16, 17</a>) Shortly thereafter, Christ began overseeing a spiritual restoration work on earth. As a result, millions have been brought into a spiritual paradise, becoming subjects of God’s Kingdom. They have stripped off the old, corrupted personality and “put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102009045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eph. 4:22-24</a>) As with the healing of the crippled beggar, this astounding work has been accomplished, not by human efforts, but by God’s spirit. Like Peter, we must boldly and effectively use God’s Word to teach others. Any success we may have in helping people to become disciples of Christ is achieved by God’s power, not our own.</p>
