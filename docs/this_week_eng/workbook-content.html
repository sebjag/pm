Huldah added that Josiah, because of having humbled himself before Jehovah, would not have to look upon the calamity but would be gathered to his forefathers and be taken to his graveyard in peace.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 22:8-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2Ch 34:14-28</a>.</p>

(<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009440/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><em>2 Chronicles 34:14-18</em></a><em>.</em>) What was the effect? The king immediately ripped his garments apart in grief and instructed the men to consult Jehovah. Through the prophetess Huldah, God provided a message condemning some of the religious practices that had been carried on in Judah. Yet, Josiah’s good efforts to remove idolatrous practices were noted, and <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>he remained in Jehovah’s favor despite the calamities predicted for the nation as a whole.

We want to respond to Jehovah’s direction promptly, taking to heart the warning example of what can happen if we allow apostasy and unfaithfulness to encroach on our worship. And we can be confident that Jehovah will note with approval our zeal for true worship, just as he did in Josiah’s case.</p>

<strong>[<em>w17.03</em> 27 ¶15-17]</strong> <br/><strong>Will You Apply Your Heart to the Things Written?</strong><br/><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>15, 16.</strong><strong> Why did Josiah lose God’s protection and his life?</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Finally, what warning can we find in what happened to good King Josiah? Consider what led to his defeat and death. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>2 Chronicles 35:20-22</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Josiah “went out against” King Necho of Egypt, although that king told Josiah that he had no dispute with him. The Bible says that Necho’s words were “from the mouth of God.” Why, then, did Josiah go out to fight? The Bible does not say.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> How, though, would Josiah know that Necho’s words were from Jehovah? Well, he could have asked Jeremiah, one of the faithful prophets. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 25</a>) But there is no record of his doing so. Also, Necho was heading to Carchemish to war “against another house,” not to war against Jerusalem. Moreover, God’s name was not involved, for Necho was taunting neither Jehovah nor his people. So it was bad judgment on Josiah’s part to battle against Necho. Can we see in this a lesson that we can apply? When faced with a problem, we do well to consider what Jehovah’s will may be in the matter.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>17.</strong><strong> When we encounter a problem, how can we avoid making a mistake like the one Josiah made?</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> If a problem arises, we ought to consider what Bible principles are involved and apply them in a balanced way. In some cases, we may want to consult with the elders. We may have given thought to what we already know about the subject, and we may even have done research in our publications. Yet, there may be other Bible principles to take into consideration, which an elder might help us to analyze. For example, a sister knows that she has the responsibility to preach the good news. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 4:20</a>) However, suppose she plans to go out in the field service on a certain day, but her unbelieving husband wants her to stay home. He says that they have not had much time together lately, and he would like them to do something as a couple. She might consider relevant Bible texts, such as obeying God and the command to make disciples. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Acts 5:29</a>) But she also needs to think about wifely subjection and being reasonable. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Eph. 5:22-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Phil. 4:5</a>) Is her husband completely opposed to her going out in service, or is he asking her to do something else just that one day? We need balance as we seek to do God’s will and strive to have a good conscience.</p>

<strong>[<em>w17.09</em> 25-26 ¶7-10]</strong> <br/><strong>“The Word of God . . . Exerts Power”</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong><strong> How should we make good use of God’s Word in our ministry?</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> What can help us to make good use of God’s Word in our ministry? A first step is to use it liberally when we preach and teach. One brother expressed the matter this way, “If you were preaching from house to house with Jehovah himself, would you do all the talking or would you let him speak?” His point was: When we read directly from God’s Word in the ministry, we are letting Jehovah speak to the householder. A well-chosen scripture will likely be much more powerful than anything we might say. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017567/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:13</a>) Ask yourself, ‘Do I look for every opportunity to share a portion of God’s Word with those to whom I bring the good news?’</p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong><strong> Why do we need to do more than merely read scriptures when preaching?</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Of course, more is needed than merely reading Bible texts to those we are conversing with. Why? Because many have little or no understanding of the Bible. That was true in the first century, and it is true today. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017567/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 10:2</a>) So we should not assume that a person will grasp the point of a verse simply because we read it. We need to take time to isolate portions of the verse​—perhaps rereading key words—​and explain their meaning. Doing so can go a long way in helping the message of God’s Word to <span id="page26" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>reach the mind and heart of our listeners.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017567/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 24:32</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong><strong> How can we introduce scriptures in a way that engenders respect for the Bible? Give an example.</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> We also do well to introduce scriptures in a way that engenders respect for the Bible. For example, we might say, “Let’s see what our Creator says on this topic.” When speaking with someone from a non-Christian background, we could say, “Notice what the Holy Writings tell us.” Or if we are preaching to someone who is secular-minded, we might ask, “Have you ever heard this ancient proverb?” Yes, we consider each person as an individual and adapt our approach accordingly.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017567/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:22, 23</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;<img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w17/2017/843" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w17/2017/842" alt="Jehovah’s Witnesses use the Bible in their ministry" width="113" height="67" class="south_center" />

<br/>&nbsp;<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong><strong> (a) Relate the experience one brother had. (b) How have you witnessed the power of God’s Word in your ministry?</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Many have found that using God’s Word in the ministry can have a profound impact on those to whom they preach. Consider an example. A brother made a return visit on an elderly gentleman who had read our magazines for a number of years. Instead of simply presenting the latest issue of <em>The Watchtower,</em> the brother decided to read a scripture found in that issue. He read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017567/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</a>, which says: “The Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort . . . comforts us in all our trials.” The householder was so moved by those words that he asked our brother to read the scripture a second time. The man mentioned how much he and his wife needed comfort, and he now showed interest in the Bible’s message. Would you not agree that God’s Word exerts power in our ministry?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017567/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 19:20</a>.</p>
